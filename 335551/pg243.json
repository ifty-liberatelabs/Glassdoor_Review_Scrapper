Open door policy meant that students were able to come in at anytime of the day, including during confidential meetings and made it difficult for me to complete important tasks. A lot of pressure was put on the academic department to pick up the slack in terms of quality when students complained about housing, activities etc. Students could be rude and aggressive, however sometimes this was understandable because they were regularly mis-sold programs by overseas sales staff and then we were expected to solve the problems with no support from then. Often felt like profit over quality education.",

When teaching seasonal courses, it is common to be in the center for 12 hours. \r\n- EF recruits and operates just like a cult. Management retains and drives staff with manipulation, not motivation. \r\n- If you want to resign and work for a competitor, EF can make the transition very difficult by withholding the reference and contract release letter. \r\n- EF China is unlikely to survive much longer due to the new Double Reduction Policy imposed by the government.

Didn't get more than a slight pat on the wrist because they are so desperate for foreign teachers.\r\nHigher management definitely only care about the money more than the children.\r\nThe summer and winter courses are long. Sometimes you are in school from 8am to 9pm. \r\nExpected to work extra and overtime for no extra pay.\r\nManagement can differ.",
