Maybe elektra was supposed to be practised during the time before the school opened, but if this is the case then it never happened! It made the whole summer very slow to get started. The senior services role wasn't utilised half as well as it should have been - our student services coordinator ended up covering for teachers and making posters and doing pointless tasks instead of being able to help with elektra as they weren't taught how to use it. There is way too much work for the academic manager on their own - they need an assistant manager to help with all of the work because in my experience our academic manager was barely leaving the office at 10pm.",

No time is spent with the students, it really is an office job where you will be expected to stay with no coffee breaks and in my experience lunch can only be taken if you insist on it.  The attitudes of returning staff make it very hard to innovate - in my experience the centre manager was stuck in their own idea of how it was run 'last year' and provided sub-standard activities and customer service because of it - this totally goes against EF's focus on the WOW factor.",
