Seriously, all we can hear about from upper management is \u201csales\u201d (recruiting more students from selling them courses) and beating way more than previous years. And what they seriously lack of is investing in the quality of the facility (aka campus facilities) &amp; their hardworking employees. If you\u2019re early in your career and/or career ambitious, please don\u2019t waste your time here. You won\u2019t get a proper training, mentor, career advancement/growth, etc. from here, when managers themselves are only focusing on their own benefits.
