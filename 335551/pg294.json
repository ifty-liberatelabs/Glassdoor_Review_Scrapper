They did not even tell us that we needed 100RMB for a security deposit at that low-quality hotel they made us stay at (which, by the way, they changed it to at the very last minute--great planning, huh?). Furthermore, EF poorly advised us on how to choose an apartment. They made it sound like we HAD to use an agent, and find a place RIGHT AWAY, regardless of how ridiculously expensive the rent was. They don't care! HQ is utterly and totally unreliable. Why do they not respond to e-mails? Why do they take forever to get things done? Third, we had awful healthy insurance. Our policy from socialist Sweden takes forever to reimburse the money--I had to e-mail them several times to get my money, and I had to pay a money transfer fee whenever they paid me back--outrageous! Why couldn't those idiots just pay me back in RMB?\r\n\r\nEF teaching materials are for the pits. Slides are replete with vague and incomplete grammar explanation, as well as just inappropriate topics for a Chinese audience (one lesson asks students to say what they would change about government--since they didn't want to go to jail, class didn't go so well). \r\n\r\nManagement COULDN'T CARE LESS about employees and what they think. Even though WE are the ones who do the teaching, and know what is best for the students, our opinions do not matter. EF is only concerned with the profits they can get from the naive Chinese consumer, who would be better off taking lessons at Wall Street or WEB International English. I knew a guy who almost got fired for expressing his religious views. It is not wonder the turnover rate is so high, and EF does not even pay for your airfare.",

                        "cons": "I was very disappointed by the management of the company and the lack of organisation. The senior staff are over-worked and can't keep up with the workload resulting in the job of an activity leader becoming 10x harder. They don't even provide something as simple as a list of students attending an activity - I had to make one myself so that I knew who I was missing when at an excursion. \r\n\r\nThey also forgot to tell me that I had at least 5 students who were claustrophobic, 1 student with diabetes and 1 student with panic attacks. This caused some serious stress during the activities and could have been avoided by clearly communicating these health issues to the leaders responsible for the 30+ kids!\r\n\r\nThe contract states that activity leaders work 6h/day - often with a gap of 3 hours in-between. This is usually never the case and you will find yourself working more than just overtime (which by the way are hours you won't get paid for). I was on my 3h break and got a call from a senior member of staff telling me that I had to pick up a student of mine because she was alone and wasn't allowed to wander around London by herself. I had no choice but to interrupt my (non-paid for) break to pick her up and entertain her until the evening activity started. \r\n\r\nThe training provided seems to be different for each countries as I had a conflict with an Italian leader. According to the London office the students have to attend all activities no matter what (the only exception is if they are ill). So I had told my student that she had to attend the Disco despite heavy rain. Her roommates however were told by their Italian course leader that they could stay in. The Italian leader then phoned me up and told me that they should all stay in due to the weather conditions. This misunderstanding and disagreement led to me passing on the phone to a senior staff who assured the Italian leader that I was right and that she should advise the students to come to the activity.\r\n\r\nLastly, they expect you to keep track of your students. Thus, when one or two are missing all I can do is call them to check their status. Most of the students do not have a local number and this will naturally result in high phone bills by the end of the month. HOWEVER, EF does not pay the phone bills of activity leaders - so if you aren't prepared to have a bill as high as \u00a3100+ then I suggest you keep clear from EF.",

Be careful; they pay you once a month but don't warn you. Sometimes they pay you late, and you can go 6-7 weeks without a paycheck. The tour contract and payment plan are confusing on purpose; you realize after a few weeks that it is a scam. Parents are required to sign it to book a tour, but then about 90% of parents end up paying huge late fees. If you don't pay your late fees, the child can't go on their trip AND you don't get the money back that was already paid towards the trip. They could very very easily make the contract and payment plan clear and easy to understand, but they don't on purpose. This is how the company makes money, it is their business model. The fees DON'T go to collections, and the Agent is able to waive ALL of the fees if they want to. The fees lead to a lot of negative calls, about 90% of calls are fights with parents. This takes a huge toll on the Agent, probably why the company encourages drinking from the beer fridge on Thursdays and Fridays. The parents are just regular (dumb) people who mostly have never traveled and don't understand how it works and are relying on a tour company to take care of the travel for their child, and then they get trapped with hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars in fees. It's exploitative. The parents threaten you, abuse you, scream/cuss at you, threaten to come to the office and find you, tell you terrible stories about their child being gang r*aped to gain sympathy/get fees waived, this is nonstop all day and all week. There's high turnover and a high rate of sick days and mental health days. Even if you don't normally call in sick, you will at this company, everyone does and it's an infectious mindset. Because of the high turnover (most people would just stop showing up) and a lot of sick people, there's a lot of work that falls on the remaining people. Lots of work + below minimum wage pay + constant verbal abuse and fighting = a terrible place to be. I wouldn't recommend anyone who is sensitive or with depression, anxiety or PTSD work here. Every single person on the Traveller Support Team cried at one point, some had to go home. Some never came back. There's no reason anyone should work here and go through that abuse for less than minimum wage; you can work at Starbucks for more money and less abuse. A lot of employees felt tricked by promises of travel and a cool Google-like place to work, and soon realized we have to endure insane amount of abuse for just $2300 a month.",
