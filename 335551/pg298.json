Since nobody at the office knew how to kick out the student, so the only thing that was even done was disabling the microphone. The next day the same student was in one of my colleague's classes... being annoying and disruptive as usual. \r\n\r\nThe director of the location I was at did not send any official \"pay stub\" like document for pay day, and there was no official \"pay day\" or procedure from what I could tell. I would always have to contact him reminding him to transfer my payment, and in my 6 months of working there, I was paid at least two weeks into the next month more than once. I recently learned the company is franchised, and it is nearly impossible for anyone from EF / EnglishTown to help me get in contact with the director from the office I worked at concerning tax information that I never received.  I find it problematic that even if the company is franchised, the company has little to no contact or control with local offices, and the director from the office I was at does not reply to emails. \r\n\r\nFinally, there was a lack of general communication and stability within the office itself, at least it seemed to me. I had to explain to multiple people my availability after being scheduled at times I was not available.  I also never knew who I should be directing my questions to or who was \"in charge\".",

The amount of effort I put in was not worth it, no appreciation, they expected me to re-sign for a measly 500 yuan more a month and was one of the top performing teachers in the region at the time, so showed how much I was initially worth to their precious company...........not worth it........and of course, they were just money hungry, which I understand, you have to make money but please do not do it at the expense of people's sanity and health. Oh, and the fun part, they have lesson plans that you are not allowed to use........so, lesson planning of every class is essential. I had up to 15 lessons to plan between many ages which can actually become quite tedious at times as they would make you re-plan a lesson plan if they did not like one aspect of it.........and my lesson plans were always loved by kids no matter what bigwig said that a certain part or all of it would not work in the classroom, go away and actually go teach a class instead of sitting on your lazy bottom in the office doing sweet nothing(our DoS, FYI). Just be careful when working for this company, I know there are some amazing places where EF is actually great to work for, but this one is just here to belittle and demean people for the sake of their own sanity most likely.",
