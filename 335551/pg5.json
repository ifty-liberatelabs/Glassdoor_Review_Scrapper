EF is in one of the most expensive parts of the country, and is right in the middle of one of the tech epicenters of the US (Cambridge). Why would anyone work for you? Do you think people with established careers and families care enough about going to Europe by themselves to work on a tour once per year to justify earning a terrible salary? It is only a matter of time until EF is forced to either compensate fairly or face the music and downsize significantly. I fully expect them to choose the latter.\n\nManagement needs to get a handle on work-life balance. Outside of the 20-25 year old TCs who are having a grand old time, morale is absolutely terrible. My boss is an ego-maniac who would feed his team to a grizzly bear if it meant he'd get a promotion.",

Over 1,000 people work in the Cambridge office, a city that is 12% Black and 19% Asian. \n-there is nowhere to park, a two-year waiting list for the parking garage at the building (which somehow still costs $180 per month), and no subsidy for commuters. \n-the benefits aren't great. the health insurance is decent, although heading into 2025 they offered worse policies that cost more. trending in the wrong direction. they also only match 25% of your 401k contribution, which is poor. Most companies will match 100% for the first few percentage points, but not this greedy company. \n-they are cheap misers. the most recent company kickoff in Montreal came with ridiculous rules around expenses, barely offering to cover the cost of fast food, never mind actual meals. There was no reimbursement if you made the trip yourself - it was their cramped bus or your wallet. Everyone had to double up on hotel rooms (except Directors and above, of course). This is a trend. They are cheap penny pinchers in every possible way.\n-there is no clear path to move up. people just jump around this company. there are so many people in positions they are totally unqualified for because vertical movement is a foreign concept here.",
