We do not tolerate bullying at any level of the organization. Please email hr@ef.com to connect with a member of our team about your experience - we take this feedback very seriously. \n\nI'd also like to share that while most of EF Boston will remain remote this summer, we have offered flexible options for those who wish to return to the office sooner, as well as a workplace flexibility plan for people to keep a hybrid schedule once normal office operations resume. This is an exciting new phase for EF.\n\nLastly, I want to reassure you that EF cares deeply about retaining good talent in all forms, and we will continue to work to be the best employer we can possibly be for all of our staff. That's why feedback like yours is so helpful. Thank you.",
