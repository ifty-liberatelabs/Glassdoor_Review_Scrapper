                        "cons": "Where do I start!  I worked for English Town when I was in Brazil and was well paid and had a very good experience.  In Brazil, I worked one evening a month as a \"host\" for an English-speaking social event.  It was fun and well paid.  So, when I returned to the States, EF was the only online company I applied to because they are the market leader and I had such a good experience with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, my experience teaching with them has been awful.  I have only worked here 2 months and already EF has found many reasons not to pay me for classes worked.  The \"hub\" in China calls all the shots and if they say you won't be paid, they don't pay.  When I have had problems entering classes or especially having a class created, the \"hub\" has declared the incidences, \"teacher technical problem\".  Which means I don't get paid.  I have seen no \"technical problem\" on my side, but apparently, EF can see that my internet connection has gone done, except that there is no notice or clue on my side.  Also, if I haven't reported these incidences, which, \"Why would I?  on my end I can't see a problem.\" then I have been fined $12, the equivalent of one class.  So, I don't get paid AND I am penalized $12.\r\n\r\nFor one class, that I knew I had problems with, I created a \"hub\" case because I couldn't teach the class.  When creating a \"hub\" case you have to input a lot of information, including the class number, the class date and time.  I made a type-o on the class number and not only wasn't paid for the class, but also was penalized for the class.  The office in China would not budge on this.  Supposedly, the Boston office will pay me for this and perhaps they will.  I'll find out when they finish the invoicing this month.\r\n\r\nThe Americans in the Boston office have been helpful and friendly, mostly, but they don't have any control over what China does.  However, the Boston office was very difficult to communicate with in trying to get my first months pay worked out.  The emails were condescending and did not explain or address my questions.   Almost 20 emails went back and forth to get my questions answered.  I didn't like any of the answers either because they were, \"We won't pay you for this and this and this and we will deduct for this and this and this.\"  \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to stay positive when teaching students after receiving emails that are condescending or that communicate that I won't be paid, or are form emails that say thank you for whatever, and I know that that is not the actual sentiment. \r\n\r\nI feel less than unappreciated.  I feel disrespected and taken advantage of.  I've been taking lots of screenshots and doing a lot of documentation.  I plan on leaving the company as soon as I have another job.  And I am also thinking about taking them to court to get the money they haven't paid me.  I was thinking of  just taking them to small claims court, but then I think that even if I got a judgment in my favor which I am sure will happen, that the company will ignore it and not pay me.  I've also thought that it would be a good idea for EF teachers to band together somehow.  Seems to me if we could organize, a class action suit would be possible, but I don't even know how to find other EF online teachers.\r\n\r\nIf you have a choice, choose another company to work for.",
