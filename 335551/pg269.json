It's easy to complain about teachers leaving, but management are not truly addressing the causes.\r\n\r\n- Offer more options for qualifications. If you want employees to stay with the company and progress, they need options that suit them.\r\n\r\n- Neutralize toxicity in the workplace.\r\n\r\n- Be honest with people during the interview stage. Many arrive expecting a traditional classroom environment rather than an ESL model. Let teachers know that they will also be expected to market the products. Furthermore, if you want serious applicants who will stay with the company and actually work hard, stop advertising the job as a holiday job! Too many lazy people are hired just to fill spaces who end up leaving after 4-5 months. Please be honest with potential teachers.",

Your line manager is under an enormous amount of pressure (or completely incompetent) and will find it difficult to stick to this time frame.\r\n\r\n- No HR department. One bad apple in the office will spoil the entire workplace, but there's no one trained to do anything about them. My second year was spoiled by an office bully who drained the atmosphere in the office.\r\n\r\n- Professional development is limited to bi-monthly workshops. Often, these workshops are led by senior teachers who would rather be doing anything else. They are a waste of time that nobody benefits from. Skills are taught through \"IknowEF\", a website with a comprehensive library of things you need to know to be an EF teacher, but is completely unhelpful outside of EF.\r\n\r\n- Taking another job in China is a nightmare caused by a vindictive policy of punishing employees and general incompetence of the company's visa department. Even if you finish your contract and are a model employee, you will be subjected to the same tactics. Your work permit and residency permit will be cancelled, even though it is legal to transfer the work permit to your new employer. They will then conveniently fail to produce your exit papers on time, even though you need them to start the work permit process again. Once you leave the company, they will make it as difficult as possible for you to remain in China or get another job and they will offer no assistance to you as you no longer work for them. \r\n\r\n- The company recently started pushing employees to get a certTESOL if you want to progress beyond senior teacher. However, you are not given a lot of windows to get one. Course spaces provided by EF are limited to the point where they had to reject a lot of applicants. Those wanting to take leave to do an intensive course are told that they need to use their annual leave/take unpaid leave while they do so.",

If you are someone who wants to try the ESL industry for a year to see if this style of teaching is for you, it's very easy to get hired. Teaching qualifications and courses are offered by the company to improve your teaching and CV.\r\n\r\n- For the most part, EF staff became like a family to me. I became friendly with teachers from across the city and we often hung out. Staff in my school were really cool and helpful.\r\n\r\n- People are promoted super fast here. If you stick around for longer than a year and you get stuck in, chances are you'll move up to senior teacher. If you have a CertTESOL/CELTA and have been with the company for more than two years, you'll have a shot at Director of Studies or maybe you'll move to another department depending on your skill set.\r\n\r\n- The hours are good. If you are organised, you'll often find that you have plenty of time on your hands. plan all your lessons in one day and get your admin work out of the way early and you can concentrate on whatever you want.\r\n\r\n- The kids are awesome.

If they can get you in the door for minimum wage, they will.\r\n- Contract work is the name of the game for this company. They will bring in employees with outstanding work history, high levels of education and expertise, and genuine talent and they will force them to work under untrained supervisors and managers with no clear vision or use for their talent. It's very frustrating and makes this a hard company for professionals looking for more than that \"first job feeling\". \r\n- Management undergoes no formal training. You take a hard gamble here because depending on who your manager is, it can become one of the most toxic working environments of your career.   \r\n- THERE IS NO HR. Something I wasn't aware of when I got into this is that there's no real HR. Sure, there's a team to manage recruitment and payroll, but if you ever have a real problem at work, you're on your own. If you're unlucky enough to get stuck under a bad manager, you're forced to sort it out yourself and either risk losing your job or just grin and take it until you burn out or manage to find another position within the company. If you do manage to get through to your manager about an issue, it is rare that anything actually changes. \r\nYou also face inappropriate conversations that fall into a grey area where the person saying the explicit or prejudiced thing just gets away with it. One that's stuck with me was when a manager told another employee, \"You're from ______, so of course your idea for this is going to be tackier than someone from Western Europe.\" \r\n- Nepotism is a problem. It's an open secret that everyone just sort of deals with. \r\n- There are serious limitations on promotions and salary increases. You learn not to believe anything your manager promises in an evaluation. \r\n- Promises aren't kept and there's no structure for followthrough. You'll be told your job involves one thing and then actually be made to do another. If you ask to speak about it, you're condescendingly reminded of the principle that we're not a \"not my job\" company and told to take it on the chin. \r\n- You could work two hours of overtime every single day and nobody will compensate it or care. \r\n- Vision changes every few months. It's very jarring to keep up with, especially if you have a lot of responsibility. Sometimes it feels like you have a different priority every single week and it's hard to value anything you're working on because even mid-way through an assignment, it could be scrapped entirely.\r\n- High rate of turnover. Some of this is because of the short contracts given to perfectly skilled and deserving employees (who might be forced right out the door once their contract expires). But most of it is because of what's been listed above. This is a hard company to stay loyal to past a certain point. \r\n- Finally, management is never accountable for anything.",

Pressure and blackmail from management - As soon as I left China, was forgotten about and forced to give up my holiday, as my manager said if I didn't give it up, they might not be able to \"arrange\" online classes for me. Felt like blackmail if I'm honest, but I wanted to get paid so gave up my holiday ( in hindsight, I shouldn't have).\n\n3.  Change in contract - As well as being put under a lot of pressure once I left China,  such as having to do online classes at 2am even though I asked for them to be rescheduled , and having to give up my holiday, also had the contract changed with just a few days notice - the contract was as follows:\n-  chinese minimum wage (\u00a3200 a month) from \u00a310,500, for the same amount of work. \n- no holiday pay.\n- no flight and they stopped paying for my apartment in China. \n- agree to \"make up\" on time spent out of china.\nDue to the company not even paying me enough to even pay my rent, I decided it was best to leave.  They said they changed the contract as I couldn't return to China as the border was closed. \n\n4. Preferential treatment - \nThey tried to keep me on by saying we were \"family\" but what kind of family, gives a paycut to half their staff.  Both the foreign staff outside of China were forced to take a paycut, and the local Chinese staff were forced to take 2 pay cuts while the foreign staff still in China got bonuses . That seems fair, doesn't it. \n\n5. Poor response from management: \nWhen I and my fellow staff complained, we were told it was our fault for leaving China. When we mentioned the disparity between staff outside of China, Chinese staff and foreign staff still in China, were told that we \"shouldn't be discussing wages, if we hear you do it again you will be fired.\" Clearly, instead of listening to us, management tried to scare us into accepting their poor treatment.",
