They bolster the bottom level of the company with overworked and underpaid entry-level employees with realistically few opportunities to actually progress. As an education company, they're completely money/business development focused and not people-centered. Profit over people at every angle, which, coming into the company from a service mindset and wanting to make positive impacts on the world was really disheartening. There is also an underlying culture of mistrust. They do a good job at gatekeeping employees from other departments. There's a lack of transparency and knowledge sharing of what goes on in the rest of the business. Teams are siloed so you don't know what's happening elsewhere. Finally, I was appalled by the initial treatment of our employees at the beginning of the COVID outbreak. The CEO sent out a massively guilting/bullying email for all employees to continue coming to the office. It was a sign of true colors - mistrust and business development over the health of its people. I would not work here again.",
