Please consider Employee's welfare, adjusting the working amount to appropriate, especially reducing the personal working load during summer academy training, \r\n\r\n. Summer Academy Training can be optional to each teachers interest and capability. At the moment, it is compulsory for teacher which is written in the contact. \r\n\r\n. If the work becomes heavy during peak period, or staff is sick, please find external teacher to support the centre.  or financial compensation those who contributed the extra long working time.\r\n\r\n. To avoid long meeting before the lessons unless it is necessary. \r\n\r\nHope above infomation finds helpful, I  wish the business runs in a good and healthy system in the near future. I wish employee enjoy woking in a well structured, fairness, justified working environment at the EF. I thank you all for your listening and understanding.",
                        "adviceOriginal": null,
                        "cons": "1. Summer Academy Teaching is very hard for me. I was told to work about 32-37 ACH (Actual Class Hour, 1 ACH equals 40 minutes lesson) per week, plus off-working time to prepare PPT, prepare lesson plan, or company training course. So, I have almost lost my personal life, I found the amount of work is huge and crazy. \r\n\r\nThe company exploited every minute of the employee's working time. During the period, my life is filled only with sleep, eat and work. Without my wife's support, she prepares meals for me, I am not sure if I can even survive, I have no time to do own cooking. I have no time to look after my child, or my family, my parents, in fact I need their supports to my work. I felt guilty about the hard time that my family experienced during the heavy work period. I have lost the balance between work and life. \r\n\r\nMy health was greatly affected, I still try my best to complete the work that I was assigned in order to support the business, to support the teach work that I have passion. I wanted to support the business and long term harmonious cooperation.\r\n\r\n2. Summer Academy Teaching is heavy with long working hour which violates the Chinese national law stated 8 hours work per day. My usual working time is about: Wed- Fri: 13:30-20:45, Weekend: 8:45-18:00, Summer Academy is from Wed-Fri: 8:45-12:15,  continuously working for 2 months. \r\n\r\n3. Under Payment without Explaining: I was told that teacher would be paid the summer bonus. When I receive salary, I was shocked that summer bonus was paid, but the other subsidy was largely cut, making the total even less than usual. Before that, I was not told that the other subsidy would be cut. I thought my hard work will receive fair amount. In order to support the business, I suffered from lacking of sleep, I worked until 4:00 AM sometimes,  in order to get ready for the second day 6-7 lesson's PPT and lesson plan. I also spent extra fee on taxi to save my energy and time for the work journey. \r\n\r\nCovering another's lesson when they are sick without paying extra class fee.\r\n\r\n4. Heavy working load and Off-time work to prepare PPT, required to prepare  about 6-7 a day. Because working hours are filled with lessons, there is not much time left for preparing lesson. \r\n\r\nLong working hours violates the Chinese law. During summer academy, I worked nearly 60 hour per week, 10-12 hours a day for 2 months.  Besides, I was required to do other tasks such as on-stage performances, cover another teacher's work when they are sick, completing extra staff learning courses. In fact, I already hardly handle the work. \r\n\r\nWhen I share my thoughts to manager, they just said: \" You need have confidence, you can do the job, some teachers are working longer hours than you\" ,  There is no adjustment for the amount of work, no finding extra teacher for the training centre. The management just average the extra work load to teachers. \r\n\r\n5. During the summer academy, I noticed many employees have choose to leave both English teacher and local teacher. I was also told by one of my colleagues she was faint in the office due to giving amount of complexity of tasks. She told me that she was assigned the heavy work that she was not capable to do. But people are quiet in the office, no one want to lose stable work even they understand the injustice. At that time, I was also thinking, the company was not easy, I should help the business. However my kindness was returned by asking more and more without appreciation, or fair financial compensation. \r\n\r\n6. Exhausting Long Meeting before lessons. You can imagine teacher finishing 1 hour meeting, straight starting the another 2 hour lessons. \r\n\r\n7. Heavy Amount of Off-work time tasks such as: Preparing PPT, writing lesson plan, completing the learning courses. \r\n\r\n8. Ignoring Staff's physical and mental wellbeing. \r\n\r\n9. I don't feel my hard work is appreciated, no thanks to my work even though I am not expected.\r\n\r\n10. If working time less than 24 ACH per week, your monthly salary is likely to be cut into  basic salary. For example, If you take annual leave,  your monthly ACH maybe affected. \r\n\r\nUnless your ACH is already high or you work extra hours after returning  to work in order to meet the minimum requirements of ACH. Otherwise you would only receive the basic salary at low rate.",

Summer and Winter are peak periods and can be intense for all involved, and we're sorry that you feel you did not receive the support you needed. \r\nSalaries and compensation are regularly reviewed to be in line with industry standards; we will continue to do this. Similarly any bonus should be clearly understood, and we will work to address any gaps in knowledge or requirement or payment details.\r\nWe will also continue to work with our local and regional managers to ensure every member of staff has what they need to be both successful in the classroom and enjoy a balanced and healthy personal life.\r\nIn the meantime, and if you would like to share more, you are welcome to do so, confidentially, as teacher.welfare@ef.cn.\r\nThank you again.",
