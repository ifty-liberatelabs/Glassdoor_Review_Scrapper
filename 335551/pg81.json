I appreciate your feedback -- your Advice to Management, in particular.  \r\n\r\nOur flat organizational structure allows staff to take on a lot of responsibility and ownership in their roles, but at the same time does not allow for a lot of \"rungs\" on the career ladder. We have been hyper-focused on investing in staff by creating leadership, development and growth opportunities absent this layered structure.  \r\n\r\nExamples of the programs we've recently offered include opportunities to travel to offices and work with colleagues around the world on \"staff exchanges;\" skills workshops that were developed based on feedback and ideas solicited from staff;  and a broad expansion of the external courses that qualify for our generous tuition reimbursement.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll join us these opportunities!\r\n\r\n- Mike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
