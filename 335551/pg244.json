Full classrooms means the only way you can move students into the correct level is by moving someone else. Students progress through the levels and it did not matter one bit if they were ready, they just all passed, all the time.  Mostly all students were placed based on their online placement test and then the day they arrived, the spoken test made no difference in about 80% of cases. \r\n\r\nThese two huge factors meant I just couldn't continue working there. I felt like I was robbing from the students because each class had such a variance of levels that it was impossible to effectively differentiate.
