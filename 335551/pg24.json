You can tell they are not accustomed to working with African Americans. Please do not apply here! Save yourself from experiencing such hate and ignorance. If you complain to HR it will only make it worse. They are the embodiment of what stereotypes you see and hear about regarding a white corporate America workplace. They assume you\u2019re dumb and if you bring it to their attention they will only play like they have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Someone needs to bring attention to their work culture and make them go viral on social media. The comments they make are so insensitive and uncultured and they say it with a smile on their face. Instead of moving around poor management they promote them. They should be careful before someone takes what's going on within the company on social media and calls for their resignation. They do not care about you. The jobs are entry level, micromanaged, and they expect you to work long hours with no extra compensation. A complete living H*LL. Terrible work culture. They need to go viral. From experience, what I've seen, that's the only way to get a company like this attention. Bring it to social media with documentation, call for change.",
