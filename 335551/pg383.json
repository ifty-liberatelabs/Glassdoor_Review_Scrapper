Through these changes, we have worked hard to provide clarity around roles, performance expectations and career paths. Another significant goal has been to link the salary review process more tightly to objective performance criteria and to make the entire process more transparent. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe highly value your feedback, and if you want to discuss anything around what you have experienced or heard, please do not hesitate to reach out to Monika (H&amp;R) or Livio (SW lab) in Zurich.\r\n- Mike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
