It felt like the Hult family had one thing in mind when COVID hit- protect themselves and their wealth. Managers were over worked, staff was forced to work major overtime with no relief in site. Sure, it's horrible being a travel based company in a global pandemic but there was more they could have done to care about their employees. Example: it took A YEAR for the Boston office to offer employees the option to pick up their office belongings and offer to borrow an office chair to use while we worked from home- any stipend for home equipment- FORGET IT. Pre-covid when they built the new Hult college campus, EF employees suffered at the hands of the students- mostly wealthy international students. Just another example of putting profit over people. The most obvious failure is how low EF salaries are compared to the same positions in the market. That's a whole other story that I'm sure you're already aware of. Look, if you're a college kid looking for a taste of corporate life, EF may be a place to start. Don't make the mistake of getting too comfortable- this isn't a place to stay for too long.",
