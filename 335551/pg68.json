You can gain experience in an office environment in sales/service, and then take your knowledge somewhere else.\n- Hard working, responsible employees tend to be taken advantage of and are not valued as much as they should be. \n- Upper and lower management are not empathetic to every day struggles though they expect their staff to be empathetic constantly. \n- Lots of turnover in the staff and management means constant restructuring and disorganization\n- Fairly low pay considering how demanding the work is and how much is expected of you from management\n\n\n\n**Recommend to a friend response**: I am adding more depth to this as I do not believe it to be so black and white.
