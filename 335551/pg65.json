I'm sorry to hear that you felt discouraged from doing that, as it is great for teachers to discuss the topics of focus tactfully and sensitively. With that said, the focus of the lesson does need to be around the curriculum, to help the learner get the review they were promised. \n\nThank you for your note on the payment process. We will continue to review the process, if business and local laws allow.",
