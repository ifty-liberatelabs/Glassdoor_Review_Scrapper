We're very proud of our onboarding process and the support we're able to provide our incoming teachers when they first arrive in China. We understand our work schedules are not for everyone but they provide some benefits, like less crowded commuting and being able to travel/explore China during non peak days. Most importantly, our work schedules are based around when our students are able to study, and are presented in advance to all applicants at the time of the job offer. Our teachers have received numerous bonuses and COVID subsidies this past year as compensation for work during these challenging times and also to remain competitive within the market. If you would like to provide more specific feedback regarding your experience with managers and colleagues please email us at teacher.welfare@ef.cn. There's always room for improvement and we are constantly looking of ways to enhance our staff's experience. Best of luck with your future endeavors.",
