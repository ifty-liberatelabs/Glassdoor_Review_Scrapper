A better on boarding policy - take 3 hours out of regional induction to run a daily life in China seminar to help new teachers adjust. Uniform/better annual leave policy - more dates would be better given you market EF as a teach and travel experience. But making a standard policy would be better as depending on the school/region the policy is different and can be difficult to plan days.",

                        "cons": "Too much of a lottery - the intensity of your work and working hours can change depending on which center you go to. Some teachers have to be at school 40 hours a week, others only 30 for same pay. Worth saying that while many people use EF as a gap year, the schedule can be quite intense while the salary feels quite light. Annual leave policy - Not a lot of dates to begin with. Annual leave application procedures seem to be different according to the school/region you are sent to. Understaffing means lots of competition for dates and no holidays allowed during probation and summer schedule (approx 4 months). Worth bearing in mind if you want to go an any longer trips while you are here. Don't overestimate how much help you will get - EF will just provide the contact details of housing agents (sometimes your school will send someone with you to viewings but no guarantee). Good chance no one will meet when you off the plane when you arrivre. Reimbursements do not happen quick. You will begin training a couple days after you arrive, you will sit through PowerPoint presentations on career development and diversity when most of the other new international teachers don't even know how to navigate daily life or don't have essential apps downloaded. It would be helpful if there was a short induction into daily life in China before training begins. Generally disorganised - Head office can be a bit vague when it comes to answering questions, and your school often tells you to refer queries to head office. So it is not the most helpful. Visa process can be drawn out especially if you are being transferred to another city from Shanghai. If EF asks for your passport always query why because I felt it was asked more times than necessary. Many go with EF because it is a large company with many years experience in China so they think things will be a lot more organised. It didn't feel like that. Lack of training - don't overestimate the amount of training you get. Some schools are very good at gentle introductions, but many are so understaffed/over subscribed that you will be teaching cover classes etc the day your work permit is complete(or before). Likelihood you will be doing this while still on probation salary. Training seemed to be more about ticking boxes and watching PowerPoint presentations.",
