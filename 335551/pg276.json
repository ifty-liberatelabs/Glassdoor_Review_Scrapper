Having said that, I did have managers that I thoroughly respected and learnt from.\r\n\r\nI made a fairly decent living with EF (compared to others I've seen on really low salaries - \u00a325k pa in London), but at the same time I often felt that for the same effort I put into the job I'd make more elsewhere. Ultimately though, it's pretty standard for people to work at EF for a few years to then go on to higher paid jobs. Therefore, I think it's just about a fair deal for EFs employees to get trained up and go on to better things. I certainly am grateful to have been there, despite the salary not being amazing.",

Teach your own way, offer lesson styles and plans extraneous to the core curriculum, provide customized client service outside of the lesson plans... do your thing. If the clients are happy and returning, it will be reflected in your ratings, and you will be left free to operate. Since my training 6 years ago, I have never spoken to management once regarding my performance or what happens in my classroom. But then, my ratings are 4.97/5.0 with 5700 classes taught. They do not tend to fix what isn't broken. \n*Very kind and understanding in the event of internet or power outages. I have never felt that they didn't believe me, and they handled my sub-outs without questions or attitude. However,  my instances were very rare and real. Cry wolf, and you might find a different story.",

The apartment offered was also run-down with a random room with broken objects/objects from previous owners. I think it would be good to mention that standards of health & safety and general building maintenance are different depending on the wealth of the region the school is based in (again China specific), and in general, less stringent than safety checks in the majority of western Europe. There was poor heating and the facilities looked generally un-cared for. The same could be said for the apartment we were provided - although I am unsure whether this is (a) differences in living standards between China-Europe (I hate saying this, but there is some truth to this) (b) the school placed us in a particularly run-down area (which I think may be the case).\r\n\r\nBeing thrown into marketing events without proper preparation was not a huge challenge for myself as I had a lot of public speaking experience, but I think for some teachers found it was a challenge. Be aware that you will be expected to perform for random groups of Chinese investors/families/prospective students.\r\n\r\nIt may seem odd to add 'other foreign teachers' but I think it is worth mentioning the often toxic work environment that can be created by homesick foreign teachers. My school may have been an anomaly, but teacher management was generally lacking whereby the favorite past-time was to complain about the company and criticize Chinese society in general. As an eager traveler, I found this the most grating and would hope that better teacher management was brought into place by HR. In general, the foreign teachers in your school will become your main source of social outlet so it's very important that there is a harmonious understanding between everyone.",

Lack of flexibility on this I believe might hinder some people from applying to EF. \r\n\r\nDisney have started to give bonuses to teacher who manage to retain students at Disney. Perhaps EF should be copying this because an added financial incentive gives more motivation to perform which will increase/maintain sales and revenue.",

We also understand that this role is not for everyone and that it does require individuals to have a certain level of energy in the classroom but we have seen numerous individual teachers bring their own teaching styles into the classroom and succeed. If you would like to discuss your experience in more detail please contact our Director of Operations at christopher.lloyd@ef.id. There's always room for growth so appreciate your feedback and wish you the best in your future endeavors.",
