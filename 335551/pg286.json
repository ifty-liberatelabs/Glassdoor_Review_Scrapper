If you are lucky to get kicked off, count your blessings, there are many companies out there who actually value a great employee! All the good employees have left & still will be leaving, major change needed in the low and middle level management. Management  should not only focus on business but also look into the actual situation of staff personally and difficulties & burden faced by the staff members. Hard working employees don't get what they deserve. There's no job security even for top performers.\r\n\r\nPerson who is close to managers or Teach Leads will get back to back promotions. I can honestly say, I have never worked for a more self-righteous, arrogant, directionless, back-stabbing, insincere, incompetent, unaccountable Company. \r\n\r\nSalesforce Department not at all stream lined. They don\u2019t know where they are heading, what they are doing, what they will be doing, what is the future but too too busy in hiring. \r\n\r\nLeadership is lacking and immature. No vision, communication or transparency. Staff lacks the motivation to improve company culture and morale. No opportunity for career growth. \r\n\r\nManager is huge egoistic person but the egos generally don't have the skill or knowledge to back the egos, but those are the people that seem to make the decisions.",

Zero respect for individual. \r\n\r\nRespect your employee and treat them well. Targets, profits and margins will take care of themselves and stop being a LALA company. Stop investing unnecessary money and time developing Bangalore office infrastructure instead invest the same on Employee development.\r\n\r\nThey think you are slave of the company they will fire you for anything like if you are not a good dancer, taking your allocated leaves, taking work from home, not meeting 9 hours etc. Do not believe in recent good reviews, they are fake! These reviews have just been written to improve the image of the company because their initial reviews are bitter but true enough to get the company blacklisted very soon. \r\n\r\nThere are much more I do not have the patience to write for hours because it will not end even after that. Just want to say those who are looking to join or holding an offer from this company please don't whatever they are offering to you because it is not worth it.
