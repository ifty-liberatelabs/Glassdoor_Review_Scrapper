Some smart people only stayed for a few months and left for better jobs (good for them).\n\n3. Some line managers show favoritsm and had poor management skills (there is a specific job title for them within the company but I'll just refer to them as 'managers').\n\nThey relay more on flattery towards upper management and misguiding their team. Unfortunately upper mangement seemed to proriteze reports from these managers and numerical performance over the well-being of the teachers. Managers, like everyone else, have teaching responsiblities, but some take advantage of their positions to assign the least amount of work for themselves, all at the expense of their team's workload and mental well-being. This happens because they are rarely held accountable.\n\n4. Diminishing perks and increased workload over the time I worked there. And my friends told me it just kept getting worse.\n\n5. When sales team made unreasonable requests, a good manger would block may of those requests; however, many mangers tended to proritze the needs of the sales team over the teacher's concerns and workload. Similar things happened all the time between different teams and within the teaching team as well.\n\n6. The cover-teaching system was awful and completely unreasonable.\n\n7. After a about 2-3 months you can go from a complete beginner to grasping the essential teaching skills. The initial trainings mainly focus on product content (internal teaching material) and getting you to teach independently as quickly as possible. Within less than 6 months, you can become a competent teacher. Sound really good right?\nHowever, after that, you stop learning anything new. Instead, you find yourself using so much energy on classroom management (kids run around/scream a lot). It's NOT because that teachers don't want to improve their skills. Most of the teaching content mainly revolves around early childhood and elementary shcool material, which quickly becomes repetitve. Your experience solely base on teaching their products, and it's not applicable outside of this company. Most of the techniquies are just 'games/activities' collection. Teachers with more years of experience often have no new ideas to offer.\n\n8. The regular training sessions are a waste of time. They demand teachers to lead the sessions without offering any rewards or incentives. Trainers treat it like a task to get through, and teachers' general feedback is it's completly useless.\n\n9. This teaching experience does not help with future career transitions and is ultimately a waste of time. When you later try to change careers (they would tell you that teachers have lots of potential getting to management or transit to other areas within the company. It's a lie!!), you'll realise that experience at a language training centre holds very little value in the job market. It's not a public or even private school and employers do not recongnize the qualifications or experience from a training center.\n\n10. Since it's an after-school training center, the working hours are the opposite of a typical job. I often got home late during the week and worked full days on weekends. I hardly had any time to see other friends, as my off days were during the week. If you expect a regular 9 to 5 Monday to Friday job, then working at an after-school training center is not for you!",

Lots of fun events and programming, plus clubs and orgs led by volunteer staff. Also new professional development and DEIB programming every month. I've seen great opportunities for career growth. Great perks including free travel - the longer you work here the more opportunities you get as well - lately I personally average 3 paid travel opportunities a year. Good health/wellness benefits, WFH twice a week. Generally managers are pretty understanding/flexible about hours in terms of if you have an appointment, have to pick up your kids, etc they will let you manager your time in a way that works for you. Lots of vacation time, unlimited sick days. The people are really what makes this place great.",

There is a lot of upward mobility - one local employee even got an int'l opportunity and is transitioning to another EU-country.\n\nSUPER INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT\nHalf the EF office in Budapest come from outside Hungary, and the vibe is very international. Working language is English and colleagues hang out with each other outside work too. Many different EF divisions are represented here.\n\nRIDICULOUSLY GOOD LOCATION\nThe Budapest office is on Andrassy street less than 3 min walk from Oktogon which is smack in the middle of district 5. Beautiful top floor terrace (with a view) where the company hosts their after works.\n\nNOT TYPICALLY HUNGARIAN EMPLOYER\nNote that this isn't your average Hungarian employer. EF's Budapest office grows fast. People work a lot (sometimes late too) and are really dedicated. There are visitors here from other EF office almost weekly. Late dinners, drinks, back to work early in the morning. In many ways it feels like a startup even though EF has more than 50,000 employees.",
