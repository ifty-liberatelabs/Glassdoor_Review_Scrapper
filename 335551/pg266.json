In terms of career development, we did implement the EF Academic Career Ladder across EF Kids and Teens schools in China two years ago. For any teacher whose school is not offering the Career Ladder, we encourage them to have a talk with their academic manager, and look at how it could be introduced into their schools. Teachers can also reach out to us at teacher.welfare@ef.com to talk about their EF career aspirations, and ways we could support them.",

You are paid an extra half hour, per hour that you work to allow for lesson planning; however if you are new to the company, a lot of time will be spent getting to know their policies and procedures and you have to learn as you go because there is only a half day training offered.  \r\n\r\nIf you also happen to be new at teaching, then you can add many more unpaid hours to you're schedule.  The school has ample opportunities for students to give feedback so you will work extra hours making sure you're lessons will be up to scratch so the students in you're class don't complain about you and get you cautioned or perhaps eventually fired.  I was working some weeks almost double the hours I was being paid for, although I did this not to avoid complaining students but out of a sense of responsibility to provide them adequate lessons which most of the time took many more hours that I was being paid for.  \r\n\r\nYou will also have to do admin work that you are not paid for, after a while you can find tricks to get some admin done on class time while the students are busy.  You will need to have high energy and not be planning to have much of a life at all outside this job during the initial first weeks.  \r\n\r\nAfter about the 4 week mark myself and a lot of other new teachers were noticing that the extra hours we had been putting in during the first few weeks were coming down as we got the hang of things.
