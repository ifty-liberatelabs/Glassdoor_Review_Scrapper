From what I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019d be fortunate to receive a 1-2% increase annually. Management can be difficult to approach regarding promotions and pay raises, which creates an awkward and toxic atmosphere when these conversations should be open and honest. It impacts people\u2019s real lives.\n- Mental health isn\u2019t necessarily prioritised, and employees in need don\u2019t receive enough support.\n- Some managers don\u2019t seem to have proper management experience. It\u2019s crucial for a manager to understand the work their team is doing.\n- They don't get back to all of their applicants when they get rejected or if the position they're applying for is filled.",

The place is badly managed &amp; unfair for example if you apply for leave it could be approved or rejected on the basis of how someone in managment feels about you. The place is a revolving door people are either leaving or being fired on a regular basis. The work culture is that of running a fear campaign because people feel their jobs could be lost at any point. They literally have outsourced a company to help them fire employees that they make regular use of. My advice if you are considering working here take the job as a stepping stone be it to propel your into the international world of esl teaching abroad or just as a means to buy yourself sometime. Stay a short while &amp; don't get caught up in the toxic culture promoted by management. Basically get out ASAP I'm talking 6/8 months max anything after that your head is on the chopping board. I know a few people who have managed to survive years but it's a dead end job with little to no room for growth and will inevitably result in losing your job its not a matter of if but rather when.",
