By far the most disorganised place I have worked at, there were no systems in place for many tasks; even for basic necessities like student registers.\n\nCut-throat and unethical practices like blackmailing tactics were used.\n\nWitnessing this and the negative effect it had on my fellow activity leaders was heartbreaking. This wasn\u2019t something I expected to observe at a school in Eastbourne.\n\nI witnessed my fellow colleagues brought to tears and go through mental anguish, due to the attempted coercion and blackmail. When they were promised one thing and once they had move away from their homes/friends &amp; families, were isolated and overworked; told to do another.\n\nMy manager kindly told me I would be sacked if I didn\u2019t go to the Quarantine Amber camp (St. Albans). Even though I specifically said at the start I don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving Eastbourne. I was honestly so surprised when they didn\u2019t terminate my contract the following week because I said No.\n\nI was never paid on time.\n\nMy contract stated I would get paid weekly but it took them 4 weeks to finally pay me. And of course, they forgot to pay me for the extra days I worked.\n\nI was put in a difficult position and forced to pay out of my own pockets for some of the Activities and train tickets for the students, using my personal card (\u00a360).\n\nI was refused Statutory Sick Pay (SSP).\n\nI had to accompany a student to the hospital; resulting in a long and stressful 18-hour work day which involved spending the night at the hospital. I caught covid from the hospital so I couldn't complete the last week of my contract.\nI notified my manager of the positive test; who didn\u2019t mention SSP at all. Few days later when I found out I was legally eligible for SSP I contacted the director, who blamed me for not sending the covid certificate, which was never requested to begin with. I was denied sick pay in the end; still haven\u2019t received or heard anything at all.",

The main goal of this company is making profit (I am sure it is other companies\u2019 goal as well, but this is preposterous) and you, as an employee, will be treated as disposable goods. They focus on recruiting people directly from their home countries and make sure to emphasize how reputable and powerful they are in China. We\u2019ve all probably heard horror stories about teaching English in China and since you don\u2019t know what to expect, you choose to go with this \u2018safe\u2019 option. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, they lie about working hours. You get around 23 hours of teaching, but for every class you need to prepare a lesson plan and do administrative work and prepare materials, which takes another 1,5 - 2 hours (it can take even more). Although lesson plans do exist, you are told they are not good and you are required to think of new games, activities etc. which can be overwhelming. Since teaching schedule is tight, you need to take the work home. Also, you are expected to do many additional activities and never be paid for overtime. Additionally, they like to hold long and boring meetings with no purpose, again just for the sake of looking serious and busy. I have to admit that I have never seen employees of one company so stressed, worn down and depressed. No wonder \u2013 being a robot in a factory is not much of a life. \r\n\r\n\r\nTaking all these factors into consideration, the pay is very low, much lower comparing to poorer and smaller schools. You won\u2019t see much of a holiday either.\r\n \r\nManagement cares only about profit and you are under a constant pressure to fulfill their magic numbers. People are promoted into senior teachers and managers only because they stick around long enough and not many people decide to stay with them after their contracts are finished. In case you decide to finish your contract earlier, they have connections and if they are furious enough, they can make your further stay in China miserable. \r\n\r\nAvoid, avoid, avoid \u2013 you are treated like a slave!",
