The regional management find that avoiding issues is their primary means of solving them -- and they do not keep any of their promises. In particular, you're often misled by EF's job postings and advertisements -- you're led to believe that you'll have plenty of time to travel around China but in reality, you're working on weekdays from 2 to 8:30 pm and 9 hours on Saturday and Sunday, sometimes working for one week consecutively with no break. At Kids and Teens Own Schools, it's up to the individual centres' DoS discretion and they will make sure to overwork you and squeeze every single pulp out of you. They possess full control over each teacher, and if they don't like you, they will try to make things as difficult as they can for you and think of every single reason to get rid of you,  and justify their actions for doing so. The DoS at my centre was nitpicky about everything and it was clear that she placed reducing the centre's costs over their own teachers' welfare. Now it's quite clear why some centres, especially in the Pudong district, are facing high turnover rates -- the DoS tries to cut down on the number of teachers, which in turn creates even more workload for the remaining teachers left, and causes a vicious loop.\r\nTeachers were sick, exhausted and overworked at my centre -- there's usually no time for dinner in between classes. Because of the conditions, work hours and lack of proper treatment, most teachers quit or do not have their contracts renewed at the end of the first year -- and individual centre managers think that it's not worth spending their precious time training new teachers when you're about to leave anyway. When you're hired, you feel like you're given support/your questions get answered and once you're actually at your centre, you're on your own. EF's core values states quality, passion and integrity, but the real situation is quite different and teachers are often placed at the bottom of the chain.\r\n\r\nI'd advise anyone who is considering coming to re-consider their motives and think hard about coming here. It's clear that there are cracks in the company's system, if there are so many teachers leaving and new teachers coming in to replace them every 2 weeks.",

I went without a Senior Teacher observing me ever for 8 months and received no feedback. \r\n \r\n\r\n* The schedule for the following week will be made Sunday evening or even Monday of that week. \r\n\r\n* Newest teachers will be assigned Marketing Events due to their free schedule. Marketing at EF Jiaxing was a nightmare where I would speak to someone a week prior about an event I was assigned to only to be told nothing was needed of me except my attendance and participation. Come the day of the marketing team member would frantically ask me to prepare something like a report to read students or flash cards for a recent holiday then tell me the event isn\u2019t 30 minutes as on my schedule but two hours. Also it isn\u2019t in the center anymore it\u2019s at a library on a stage. \r\n\r\n* The weekly workshops at EF Jiaxing contain no development or educational value.

                        "cons": "Where to start? I\u2019ve lived all over the world and worked in a myriad of work environments- I\u2019m not adverse to hard work, but everything about EF is \u2018predatory\u2019. \n\nThey actively recruit students right out of university that have little to no idea about what they want to do in the future. They promise them relatively decent pay vis-a-vis the current living cost. They additionally swear \u2018up and down\u2019 that new recruits will positively \u2018love\u2019 China and that they\u2019ll be supported! \n\nThe reality is starkly different. I found myself in China after my BA for no other reason than I wanted to learn Mandarin- I already speak several other languages and thought this would round me out. I began teaching classes after just one week of observation, which should\u2019ve been the first red flag. As we were so short staffed due the ever-growing number of people that did \u2018midnight runners\u2019 because of the poor work environment, I easily worked 50 hour weeks from the start. This was later compounded by mandatory summer and winter schools that added another 12 hours and reduced my time off to just one, singular, solitary day. Were we compensated for the extra time in the class room? Hardly- we were given just 600 kuai per \u2018camp\u2019, which translates to just \u20ac80  or $85 at the time of writing. If you think that \u20ac6 to $7 per hour sounds bad for a college graduate, JUST WAIT! \n\nThe regular salary is abysmal- positively abysmal. I\u2019ve been paid better for internships. For a 50 hour work week I was paid just \u20ac1.190 or $1,290 per month. Which, again, averages out to an almost WHOPPING \u20ac6 or $6.50 an hour. If that wasn\u2019t horrific enough, any halfway decent apartment costs at LEAST \u20ac400. And that living stipend they promised you? That covers maybe half, if you\u2019re lucky. You aren\u2019t able to save, in fact, you just barely scrap by. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point. If you want to break your contract for any reason, you have to pay them- 30,000 kuai (\u20ac4.000) to be exact. Given the cost of living and the salary they pay you, you could maybe, MAYBE, afford to do that after 10 months if you\u2019re prudent with your money, but even then that\u2019s incredibly difficult. They\u2019ve got you exactly where they want you. \n\nBut why would you want to leave? If being paid a slave\u2019s wages wasn\u2019t discouragement enough, perhaps the work culture might be? Whilst working 50 hour weeks and consistently covering for other colleagues that had left or taken ill from the stress that came with the job, I was asked to repeatedly stay longer to decorate classrooms and just generally put in more time that was necessary. If you called in sick (because frankly, working with kid\u2019s really tests your immune system) you had to qualify your sickness with the DOS. I had horrific gynecological issues whilst in China and despite my embarrassment, had to brief the management team when I asked to take a day off. I was once only allowed to leave my post after being sick in a trash bin. \n\nBut, that\u2019s only the metaphorical \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019. Whilst working for EF I experienced sexual harassment, threat of violence and, to a less important degree, workplace misconduct. I had a colleague yell harassment at me at a work event, telling another colleague that I was a \u2018whore\u2019 and a \u2018slut\u2019, despite the fact that we were only talking about 90s pop. This continued into the workplace, when he frequently made comments of a sexual nature to me. My DOS, Carmel\u2019s, response was that I shouldn\u2019t be so provocative, despite the fact that I was wearing the company issues navy blue polo and ankle length khakis. Who would\u2019ve thought that golf is the sexiest sport? \n\nA few months later, a 13 year old came to my class with a switchblade. He threatened another student that often made jokes at his expense. I stepped in between the two boys and managed to wrestle the knife away. I went to my manager directly and said I would no longer teach the child as I didn\u2019t feel safe and didn\u2019t want to feel unsafe in my work environment. Her response was to send a note home with the offending teenager, which was obviously ineffective. He remained in my class until I left my post. \n\nLastly, my DOS was sleeping with a Senior Teacher, who was arguably promoted because of his personal relationship, not because of seniority. She would regularly come to our office and sit in his lap or just generally throw herself at him. \n\nWhen I tendered my letter of resignation to my DOS\u2019s boss, I received an exit interview. Who should be in this interview, but my poorly behaved DOS? She proceeded to effectively try to \u2018rip me a new one\u2019 mid-interview. It had the opposite effect, I believe. \n\nTLDR; Don\u2019t work for EF, you will regret it.",

Co workers, especially PAs, will throw you under the bus at any given opportunity. \r\nTheyll try to lie about your passport being somewhere else, and theyll hide it at Headquarters so you cant leave- report to embassy if this happens. Adults is much better to work with if you can get into it, but its being phased out. Kids and teens at most centers is a nightmare. \r\nThe certifications and promotions are gate kept at all costs so you can stay longer to get them. Dont expect your recruiter to support you once you\u2019re there- they also get incentive to keep you there and really dont care about YOUR best interests.

If you want to quit you have to pay an exorbitant fee (in USD) to buy out your contract or hand in a 3 month notice, if you do hand in your notice you will be abused and harasses by management until your flight leaves, even in the months before your contract is up you will have multiple hours-long meetings about signing on for another contract (like a coerced confession). The students are pushed to breaking points by parents and the school doesn't help, why are we giving a 4 year old an exam? The \"stars\" system from the 80s or 90s that rewards children for good behavior in class and punishes them for bad behavior by adding and taking away stars is mandatory despite being unhealthy and out of date. Neurodivergent children and children with physical disabilities are left behind unless their teacher is aware of ways to help or is neurodivergent or disabled themselves. No training or direction on how to teach children with these disabilities, as an autistic person I tried to make my classes as accessible as possible and despite being the newest teacher, became the Go To in the office for disabled children, with no support, acknowledgment, or backing from management. Chinese culture is very much about saving face and this clearly western company uses that against all staff, especially local staff in public shaming of minor mistakes (not pulling up the blinds in the classroom, etc), treats local staff absolutely abysmally- 60-70 hour work week with 2 day off for them always, 5-8000 CNY per month, fewer vacation days, more responsibilities, all while called and treated as a teacher's assistant by management. Depending on the city you go to and who hired you, will only hire white people, especially blonde and attractive white people, some cities will hire black and brown people, probably nowhere will hire people of Chinese or Asian descent as foreign teachers. Management, at least at my location, has a deep disrespect of Chinese culture. One of the only requirements for being management is not leaving after 1 or 2 contracts, so there's upward mobility I guess? But that also means that the people who are okay with being treated this way are now in charge of everyone and often will continue the cycle. The school I am in will lose 4/7 foreign teachers in the next 6 months with no sign of being able to get more, 6/10 of the local teachers are planning on leaving as soon as they can, and they are still finding a way to blame it on the employees. A management seminar in Shanghai said people leave because of \"no loyalty\" and \"culture shock\". We have had so many employees stay for 2 weeks before leaving, and even more desperately want to leave but can't because of financial, contractual, or other reasons. Unless this company changes it's going to collapse and crush everyone in it, especially teachers and students.",
