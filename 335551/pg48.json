EF knows everyone can be replaced eventually so it's more beneficial for them to spend money on events/culture/PR.  There are many entry-level type positions with few advancement opportunities so don't expect to get rich working there!  If you're not drinking the \" EF Kool-Aid\" then it can be a discouraging place to work.",
