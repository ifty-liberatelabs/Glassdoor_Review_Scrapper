A lack of effective managers and management experience is my chief complaint. Management positions are filled internally when it doesn't even make sense. I am often in dismay at the lack of professionalism management exhibits or excuses here. I think they get away with a lot by mostly managing young, entry level post-grads. It's a strange power dynamic.\r\n-If diversity is important to you, this probably isn't the right workplace environment for you. On top of a lack of surface level diversity, the workforce is painfully homogeneous; it's a perfect example of a company that says they are always striving to increase diversity in hiring, yet somehow also seems to constantly prioritize the notion of \"culture fit\" without realizing their culture may be running counterintuitive to their goals to diversify the workforce. There are people who really care and put on incredible diversity events, but the participants are those who need diversity training least: mostly those who already identify within a minority group.\r\n-Lack of career direction or definition. Modest annual raises and no additional compensation opportunities. \r\n-No flexible work policy. At best, EF is way behind the times here. At worst, they don't trust their employees.",

They promise bonuses as if they're basically a given. I was a top performer and struggled to hit goals a lot of months because of the aggressive nature of them. \r\n2. Also regarding pay, it's so low. It's ridiculous to be living in Denver and being paid half of what your fellow sales people are at different companies. Especially when getting the bonuses isn't as easy as initially promised.\r\n3. There is NO room for upward mobility. They act like they're grooming you to work at EF forever, which a lot of people want, but only 1-2 roles open up per year and they're usually sales related and 15-20 people are interested in it. More centralized roles need to be moved to Denver in order to keep top talent within the company.\r\n4. Most notably, and probably one of the last straws before I left, was the carelessness of our CEO. The way he handled COVID, BLM, and so many other challenges to the business showed me and many others in our company he genuinely did not care about us or his customers. He is condescending, and quite frankly it never feels like he wants to be speaking to us. I would describe his behavior as if he never really wanted to inherit the CEO responsibilities from his father who started the company.",

If you want to stay a TC, there are plenty more opportunities but do not come with any sort of pay increase. \r\n-Workload is unsustainable and inadequate compared to pay. Old systems result in additional time and steps to get simple tasks done. The job can be extremely taxing and it is common to get the recommendation to \u201ccome into the office on the weekend\u201d when you feel overwhelmed and share that with mgmt and others.\r\n-Goals are set by mgmt without much reasoning for how they are set. Goals do not reset quarterly and instead continue to increase, so if you are behind one month, you get even more behind the next. \r\n-Lots of uncertainty during COVID. To a degree, this is understandable given the inherent decline in the travel industry, but the problem lies in upper management continuing to share their optimism for the future of the business with no evidence to support their claims.\r\n\r\nAll in all, EF is a great place to work in your twenties, learn how to be a great salesperson/account manager, and then take that knowledge to another company that will pay you what you are worth.",

                        "pros": "I'm honestly shocked to see so many negative things written by employees and former employees of Englishtown on this website. I worked for Open English before Englishtown, and I can honestly say that my work is so much easier and so much less stressful now. Englishtown is pretty much the best place you can work for as an online ESL teacher as far as I'm concerned. I was worried about student ratings and penalty fees and all of that before I started working for Englishtown, but I've been here for almost a year and have not had any issues with fees or management. In fact, the support team, while admittedly not the best, is overall very efficient. In my opinion, they really aren't harsh about class issues that may affect your pay. They are understanding and kind.\r\n\r\nThere is literally no lesson planning in this company, which is great. Even if you have a custom topic request by a private student, you can usually find a related lesson from Englishtown for them or you can just find something quick online. You don't need to go out of your way to make this huge presentation for them. Usually they just want to talk and maybe learn some new vocabulary words related to their custom topic. In fact, most private students who choose \"custom\" as their lesson topic just want to chat. It's not a big deal at all.\r\n\r\nUnlike some other online schools, you get to work with students from all over the world and not just one specific region of the world. I've learned so much from my students about their unique cultures, and it's definitely made me want to travel even more than I already do. It's always interesting to have classes with a mix of students coming from all different places and cultural backgrounds. I think the students enjoy it, too. They ask their classmates about their home countries. It helps create a really fun and inquisitive atmosphere in the classroom.\r\n\r\nGroup classes are supposed to be set at a max of six students. This is usually the case; however, I've had classes with seven a few times. Generally, I'd say classes usually have around four or five, sometimes lower. Time management is always challenging, but the lesson content is above average quality (compared to what I've seen in previous companies), which helps teachers get through most if not all of the content in 45 minutes, even with big classes.\r\n\r\nThere are usually plenty of hours on the scheduling board. Subbing and picking up hours is easy and efficient.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned this first: US (and I think maybe worldwide, too) teachers just got a really nice pay raise. Plus, teachers get evaluated every few months (the criteria is fair and not hard to meet) to get pay raises. I started out making $11, then went to $12 with the standard pay raise implementation that happened in October 2014, and now I'm at $13.20 after a recent performance evaluation.",
