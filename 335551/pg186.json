They keep hiring new people especially students doing internship, which they seem to prefer... -Law salary -You almost always work during week ends and festive and you are not paid more for that...maybe they will give you some more days for vacation if you ask. - They can fire you for nothing. They don't teach everything you need but they are convinced that they do so. If you do a mistake can they fire you easily. I would still suggest to take this job because the job itself is nice and it's a good experience but I would suggest to also have another job together or just do it while looking for something else.",
