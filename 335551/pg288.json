However, it is now set on warm temperature and we are expected to work in an office that is above 35 degrees Celsius.\r\nThe Course consultant staff tend to be malicious, back-stabbing, gossiping and money-minded who do anything to get a sell and even if its at the expense of others jobs.\r\n\r\nSo if you wish to work at EF and have a year of hell, where you are exploited, used, under-paid EF is the best place for you.

                        "advice": "You are on the way out.  There are wonderful fast growing companies who treat their teachers with respect and genuinely care about providing excellent service to their students.  Students are leaving you.  Teachers are leaving you.  They are finding these companies that are loyal, offer true flexibility and increase in pay to long term teachers.  These companies understand that the teachers are valuable and the face of their company.  Also, they are honest with the students.  These students are happy with the progress they make because they haven't been promised fluency in record time.  They haven't been told lies just so they will sign up with the company.  These companies are building a solid foundation of happy teachers and happy students.  They understand where their true success will come from.  Very soon you won't have a company left.  And good riddance.",
                        "adviceOriginal": null,
                        "cons": "Recent increase in work load (this includes writing corrections which teachers used to get paid for if they chose to do so as extra work). If not performed, pay will be taken away - from 30% to 100%.\r\nVideo is now a requirement for private lessons.  Not worth the low pay.\r\n\r\nREAD THE CONTRACT VERY CAREFULLY!  You will notice all your rights as a 'contractor' are made obsolete.  You will be treated as a laborer but without any of the benefits.  The contract's wording is very vague, allowing them to freely increase workload, take away pay etc. when they choose to do so.  For example, if you teach your class, but do not submit your report within a certain period, you can receive up to a 100% pay penalty.  In fact, on certain occasions, they can actually choose to 'fine' you.  That means not only forfeiting your pay, but also providing them compensation out of your own pocket.\r\n\r\nThe reports for each student is incredibly lengthy.  They have many, many requirements that must be met.  If reviewed by the company and not up to 'standard', then unpaid retraining regarding reports may be required.\r\nEnglishtown does not care about the student..  Recently they have been signing up anyone and everyone they can.  This now includes students with a zero level of English, despite the fact that students were required to have at least a certain level of English in order to understand the teacher and/or the lesson plans.  This means frustrated students with unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\nSound issues are horrendous with the platform they use. And yet Englishtown does not allow Skype to be used unless the student directly asks for it (many of which are not aware of this option and teachers are not allowed to volunteer this option either).  This may even mean the student forfeiting their lesson.  The technical support is of very poor quality.  Students who inquire the company for technical support often go months with unresolved technical issues and eventually give up.  You will see many students that have a long history of \"student no shows\".  Each class is paid for by the student but they are not able to participate.  The majority could have been taught on Skype with minimal issues, but again, this is not an option students are to be made aware of.\r\n\r\nEvery time the company expands, they figure out a way to a) Increase the workload of teachers to increase revenue and/or b) Decrease pay to increase revenue.\r\n\r\nThe teacher is just a number.  Don't expect to be treated like a valuable addition to the company.\r\n\r\nThe more years you spend with them, the more likely your pay will decrease and/or your work load will increase.  You will not experience any sense of loyalty on the part of the company.\r\n\r\nMany teachers are now leaving the company due to the many negative changes.  This used to be a great and fun company to work for.  But things changed.  They no longer care about the student.  They no longer care about the teachers.  They don't even seem to believe in what they do anymore.  It's all about the dollar; squeezing every penny they can get out of their students and teachers.  \r\n\r\nExpect a lot of pressure.  They try to lecture their teachers through their mass emails that this is a \"career\" despite the fact that you signed away your rights, there is no room for growth and no chance for a salary increase.\r\n\r\nDo not waste your time with this company.  It is not worth the low pay and high stress.",
