The schools are provided with good quality books, classroom props, and whiteboards that allow teachers the means to teach engaging classes easily. The pay is quite good, especially for the hours worked. You can tell EF Shenyang truly supports their teachers in terms of helping them improve their abilities through the helpful swap workshops, friendly peer-offered advice, and insightful coaching sessions offered regularly by the teaching staff. Overall, it is evident that they truly care about the quality of education their students are getting.    \r\nOn a personal note, my experience with EF Shenyang was fantastic. I had great classes where I was able to properly have classes that were educational but fun. The teaching and admin staff were great and supportive. I have zero regrets working here and would recommend the experience to anyone.",

It's amazing how much of the local language you pick up as a kids teacher too.

There is little incentive or reward for innovation in teaching, and the workload is fairly heavy, so sometimes you end up clicking through powerpoint presentations rather than actually pro-actively teaching.\r\n\r\n* The company is overly focused on sales, which sometimes leads to bad outcomes for students and management don't really care about the quality of education that is offered as long as students don't ask for refunds (although this is endemic in the training centre industry in China). For all that EF relies on its corporate image as a company that treats education seriously, in my experience, education is very much a secondary consideration to student satisfaction and successful NPS ratings.\r\n\r\n* The corporate culture ground me down a little. Your mileage may vary, but for me the enthusiasm with which central initiatives have to be met, and the constant pressure to be a happy, smiling, 'EF person' had vaguely Stalinist undertones. Toning this down (as well as EF's garish pink colour palette) and encouraging innovative thinking on the ground might improve both morale and performance.\r\n\r\n* If you join the company as a teacher, there is little in the way of meaningful career progression available. Once you are teaching 'satisfactory' lessons, the incentive to progress isn't really there. The career progression opportunities which are available are limited, and inconsistently awarded, as management seems to operate on a patrimonial basis, which sometimes results in the wrong people being promoted.\r\n\r\n* Pay is low compared to equivalent jobs in training centres, although it is worth noting that International Teachers still receive a very comfortable salary by local standards. \r\n\r\n* Holidays for teachers are good compared to many Chinese companies: new employees end up with 21 days a year. However, if your goal is to travel in China, you may be disappointed. Additionally, teachers are required to be in the office for 40 hours a week and most of the time they will teach until 8 or 9pm. If your goal is to see China or learn the language, you will get an easier schedule and longer holidays working in a university, although it is worth noting that EF pays slightly higher than the average salary teaching in a university in China.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, I would say that if you're a new teacher interested in moving to China (and potentially a career in China after EF), then EF is worth considering as they do provide more support than many of their competitors. If, however, you're an experienced teacher, passionate about education or interested in immersing yourself in Chinese culture, you can probably find something else more suitable.",

If you are part of the corporation you will find many pros, and not so many cons. \r\nBut working for a school I found:\r\nExcessive dependency on the \"extra mile\". Employees are highly underpaid, extra hours (you will have to do many)  are not compensated. When you are not able to achieve this you will be made feel guilty by managers for not \"being a team player\" or not \"going the extra mile\". When you actually do, you will not be recognized for this.\r\nYou are put in charge every 3 months or so of an emergency line that works 24/7 during the weekends without extra pay. Training for this is extremely limited and cases may vary from small issues that are easily solved to real emergencies that are incredibly stressful and not suitable to be coped by every employee. \r\nToo many responsibilities to handle by unprepared staff. The company is highly stingy and hires many interns (unpaid).\r\nDespite the company having strict rules about expected student behavior, it all seems to be forgotten for the sake of money.\r\nLawsuit threats happen on a daily basis, and with reason. Sales departments around the globe are focused on selling an incredible amount of courses in such a short amount of time to the point of being dishonest with the customer and simply not following the right procedures, affecting everyone along the way: students and employees.\r\nThe turnover of staff is incredibly quick. Most employees around me didn't last more than 2 years. Everyone was quite unhappy and frustrated professionally. \r\nThe company has many great families that host the students, but they are constantly mistreated with a terrible pay and no compensation whatsoever when mistakes happen. The company relies on the families' goodwill, without actually caring for them. It is quite a challenge for the accommodation team that has to deal with disappointed families on a daily basis.\r\nMany team building activities do happen, but most of them end up becoming an alcoholic fest. If you are an introvert or socially anxious person this will not be an environment for you. Not going to the activities is of course always an option, but you will later be judged for it as \"not a sociable employee\" or \"doesn't get along with fellow coworkers\"\r\nMany things have to be improved.",

Our commitment to the safety of our students and staff is also demonstrated by the training and support we offer to our staff who have responsibility for executing our emergency response plans.  \r\n\r\nPeople \u2013 including our employees, customers, host families, and the communities in which we operate \u2013 are at the core of our mission.  We work hard to do right by our employees, which includes providing competitive compensation packages (including, at the very minimum, complying with the various laws governing pay in all of our locations).  We highly value our host families and always honor our commitments to them.\r\n\r\nThank you again for this feedback.

I've worked in a number of companies, both in my home country and in China, and I must say, they're in general the friendliest (and intelligent too) bunch I've come across. It's a real pleasure being able to work alongside talented individuals like these.\n+ Wonderful, caring managers who care about their employees (everywhere I've worked, anyway).\n+ Ample time for preparing classes, and for newer teachers, there are fewer classes as planning them is more difficult when you begin (I think this is very well thought out).\n+ Very clear terms and conditions in detailed contracts from the beginning - a very professional company (I've worked for others in China that are nowhere near this).\n+ Proper visas - they won't screw you around.\n+ The CEO and the very top team are very business-minded, and have a clear vision for the company. I like that in challenging times, they don't just 'shut up shop', and instead, try and make things work through adjustments.\n+ The training is second to none. I've recently been on a fabulous Cert TESOL course to gain more experience - the tutors were excellent, and despite having 4-5 years at EF, I've learned even more from it. It's just a shame some of those great people are leaving soon.\n+ You're always listened to (at least, whenever there is anything truly serious happening).",
