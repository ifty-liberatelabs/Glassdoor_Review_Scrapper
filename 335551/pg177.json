Make sure you check facts before firing people to stop inner-department bullying. Think about staff over profits, including not letting students be homophobic, racist, or transphobic. Ask to see group chats and internal messaging, where bullying is happening during work hours. Ask departments how managers are doing and keep an eye on their work rather than letting them blame temps. Make the firing process smoother so people don't get abusive Sunday morning phonecalls and learn their job is over via an exit survey. Make sure the adverts match up with the jobs and hours actually given to people and ensure overtime is actually paid.",

Lots of cliques which means temp and new staff will never stay long or feel welcomed. Lots of group chat hypocrisy and talking behind each other's backs, especially the women. The women will gang up and get people fired if they don't take to them or feel threatened. There is no investigation, and managers lies have too much power.\n-There is nothing in place to keep you safe from discrimination. I reported homophobia and transphobia and was told it was not a big deal. I was also spoken to inappropriately by a male colleague and the managers did nothing. The staff is not protected from each other, the kids or their parents, even when they start to discriminate. If someone refuses to speak to a gay member of staff, they allow it.\n- You will be paid to work overtime and will never be paid. They will ask for weekends and evenings, and promise days in lieu but fire you before paying. I was hired with a 20 hour contract but ended up working 50 hours, 6 days a week.\n-You will be fired through email and then they will make up an excuse as to why. Not working evenings (even when not contracted), no car for when the job suddenly requires driving, restructuring the department. There is no transparency nor are you given a chance to stand up for yourself. This allows supervisors to manipulate their team to ensure their friends stay over good staff members.\n-The job advert and your actual job will be very different. Ignore the hours, location and tasks included.\n-The students will be lied to and you will be asked to lie to them. No safeguarding, no care for wellbeing, as long as you make money. Managers lie to cover up their mistakes and use the youngest and temp staff as scapegoats. Their friendship is more important than student safety.",
