As a result teacher turnover is extremely high. It is a motivator to leave the school. Create salaried teacher positions and teachers may stay. Even a full time teacher only makes 25k with no paid vacation or sick days. This school is in Westchester County and only pays this much... pay teachers 35k and maybe they won't leave. All I can say is that while EF tries to be a school their true profit is made from their ability to bring in students for a long period of time on I20 visas which all rides on an ability to maintain accreditation. The way the school is run academically it may be a miracle if it is approved again. Also, for 25k you will teach 35 hours a week.... yes. In a classroom for 35 hours a week. This is not a normal teaching experience... \r\n\r\nThere are many amazing people who work here but most of the time they will leave for a real career. \r\n\r\nIt's a gig, not a job.\r\n\r\nBottom line.

Also, management will treat you like a child and attempt to use \"free beer\" or \"free swag\" to distract employees from their low pay.

We're committed to paying staff in all roles competitively and fairly, which is why each year we review and make adjustments to the compensation for all roles.\r\n\r\nCareer development in a flat organization like ours can be tricky.  We recognize that it requires staff to own their development by making the most of the opportunities, tools and resources we provide.  To that end, our focus on staff growth and development has been supported these last few months with the launch of several new initiatives, including providing a robust monthly menu of professional development opportunities; publishing the opportunities across North America that are perfect for internal staff; and holding our quarterly EF Opportunities Spotlight (the first of which featured exciting opportunities in China).  We also rolled out our fall manager training series and, just last week, held our bi-annual two-day New Manager Training for all new managers across North America.  \r\n\r\nI'd love to hear any additional ideas you have for how we can continue to support all of our staffs' growth and development.  \r\n\r\n-- Mike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
