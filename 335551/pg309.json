I hate to hear that you didn't enjoy your time here, but am glad that you seemed to have met some good people and saw new parts of the world while working with us.\r\n\r\nIn the last year, we've rolled out dozens of new professional development opportunities for managers so that they have the knowledge, support and resources to be great leaders for their teams.  We've also worked hard to grow our staff through training and weekly Staff Coaching Office Hours and by empowering them to entrepreneurial within their roles.   Additionally, we've beefed up our programming and internal Employee Development Team resources dedicated to helping staff propel their careers by transitioning to exciting new roles internally -- often in EF offices  abroad or in different products.  \r\n \r\nI do appreciate your feedback and hope you'll contact me directly with any additional ideas for how we can continue to improve.  Thanks,\r\n\r\nMike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
