They tend hire a lot of competitor staffs - which makes the company culture very dependent on who is the line manager as it changes as quickly as the manager changes. \r\n\r\n3. As a very sales oriented company - and combined with point #1 this is tough for a lot of people, as soon as the sales are not on track, despite other aspects - 97% of the case: someone will be removed from the position. This process is / can be very different for each role, but most of the time, it will be same day notice (which affect the team dynamics &amp; team spirit to see people suddenly dissapearing).",
