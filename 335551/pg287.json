It is given to employees who do not deserve it and the role and its name is really fancy. If a person who deserve promotions gets one, then the other who doesn't deserve a thing is also promoted because he is close to his manager. Wow!\r\n\r\nThe Hike scene is another world class activity! This time it was delayed for 5 Months and guess what it was peanuts to those who deserve it and the one's closer to the Managers got good hikes. So in Short it is Political Based than Performance Based.\r\n\r\nScrum Masters! Well - Its a sad scene again. Bookish Knowledge! No Practical Understanding! Act as Project Managers And No Surprise - They are CERTIFIED in all possible areas. One or Two work hard to achieve the goal and the other ones just show off as again they are so-called certified to show their Bookish knowledge\r\n\r\nAgile Coach please do not consider yourself as the owner of Jira! Honestly you are there to solve bigger problems and ensure the Scrum Masters are actually accountable for their work\r\n\r\nWith the New Office Management, things are shaping up good. But there is a high requirement to clean up the HR Department. The HR department needs to stop whining about not having enough power  and work with NO FAVOURITISM!",
