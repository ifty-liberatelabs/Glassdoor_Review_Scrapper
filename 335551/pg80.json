However, my time at EF Tours working as a tour consultant burned me out within the first few weeks and has lead to me feel compelled to share with others. \r\n\r\nI read ALL of the reviews before I even interviewed with the company. A lot of the complaints were the very reasons I quit only a few months in (a few of those I trained with followed suit shortly thereafter). EF hires people straight out of college with the intent of paying very little and working you into the ground with little or no appreciation. When I say paying you little, what I mean is they aren't paying nearly enough for the amount of work that is expected of you. If you're on time, you're late. If you leave on time, you're leaving early. Weekends are expected of you. You must make arbitrary goals to keep your weekends. I was shocked when a manager tried to band-aid working late hours by actually buying alcohol to have at the office to drink while on the clock and talking to clients (yet they preach professionalism and management skills).\r\n\r\nThey describe the position as a glorified teaching job with travel incentives. In reality, you work for a calling center and spend most of your day begging secretaries to let you talk to a teacher. You travel\u2013\u2013possibly once a year if they don't fire you within the first 4 months (truth). \r\n\r\nIf you're a young professional ready for your first job and are considering EF, I would encourage you to look at ALL of your options and really consider some of the honest experiences people have had with this company.",
