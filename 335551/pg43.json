This results in materials for adult students in their corporate trainings to be for those who have just finished a university in another country--not for those who areadly work in English-speaking companies. The majority of the clients are the latter, so this can be frustrating for the client paying so much money to improve skills in CURRENT JOB positions. The focus is also more for profit and increasing the number of offices available than quality teaching. Hopefully, this will change in the future. If you have a master's degree, you won't want to work here; teachers are paid very little, even though the clients pay more than US$100/hour.",
