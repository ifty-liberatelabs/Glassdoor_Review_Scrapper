I'm sorry to hear you've left EF, but it sounds like you've taken with you some great professional relationships and memories.\r\n\r\nI'm also sorry to hear your salary didn't meet your expectations.  We regularly revisit and benchmark our compensation against industry and geographical standards so that we can remain competitive.  Our total compensation includes not just employees' salaries, but also their bonus potential (which is common in sales roles), incredibly heavily subsidized and top-of-the market insurance,  a 401k match that increases as your contributions increase, generous time off programs, and international travel perks.  \r\n\r\nBest of luck in your next endeavor!\r\n\r\n-- Mike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
