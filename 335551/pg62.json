In an initial interview, a manager told me there was no room for promotional growth and they were looking for salespeople to stick around for 1-2 years -- this seems to be true across the board in most departments.\r\n- Disconnected and untouchable management. Lack of direction, inspiration, or leadership all around -- untrained and unprofessional. Any mistakes would go unacknowledged or be pushed onto the sales staff to solve.\r\n- Training was almost non-existent, but we were expected to hit sales goals immediately. Sales goals were set arbitrarily, and the pressure coming from higher up increased management issues on a team level.\r\n- Poor organization and lack of ethics when it came to customers. We were encouraged to bend the truth to our customers or ignore them in favor of getting more sales, especially in high season. In high season, the company overbooks locations and shifts blame onto customers for 'unreasonable expectations'.\r\n\r\n\r\nEF's stated goal is 'opening the world through education', but the business model seems to very clearly be hitting the goal of 'making the Hult family as rich as possible' at the cost of employees and customers, so why change anything?

However, it\u2019s clear your experience here was not what any of us would have hoped. I\u2019d like to address a few points from your feedback. While each team will have some peak times during the year that may require additional hours leading up to key deadlines or goals, EF values work/life balance and it\u2019s part of our culture to protect that balance. If someone works a Saturday, typically they would take another day off during the same week. As for healthcare, we were surprised to see your comments. We offer market-leading healthcare coverage and provide two options for full-time employees: a basic plan and an enhanced coverage plan. Both plans provide more than adequate coverage to meet state requirements and aim to give employees a choice of how much coverage they prefer. Even with the enhanced plan, the out-of-pocket contribution by employees is quite low compared to other employers. Additionally, treating our customers with the utmost care, honesty and ethical standards is core to what we do \u2013 it\u2019s one of the reasons for our continued growth over the past 55+ years. We do appreciate your feedback and hope you find a work environment that feels like the right fit.",

                        "adviceOriginal": null,
                        "cons": "I want to preface this by saying that I'm sure that they will respond to this review saying that they're sorry EF didn't live up to my expectations or that I wasn't a good fit. In reality, I was a great fit which is why I was at the organization for 5+ years in a variety of roles and responsibilities, constantly achieving and exceeding my sales goals, a leader and mentor to my teammates and peers, and moved between offices. In reality, by putting it back on employees for \"having different expectations\" or \"not being a good fit\" the leadership at EF is choosing to ignore the trends in these reviews and the very large and real problems their organization faces. Instead they are choosing to continue to do business as they always have and will continue to do so in the future. \r\n \r\nCompensation:\r\n\u2022\tIt's not competitive, plain and simple. Making $40-50k as a successful sales rep at a reputable organization is appalling. I knew so many people (myself included) that had a side hustle to pay bills. Bonuses are paid out all or nothing, so great if you can hit your goals but not great if you sell 99% of your goal. You will hear often that reps \"have the potential\" to make 6 figures, but I would really dig deep and ask for percentages that are actually making that much. Bonus potential is also the same across the board no matter your territory size, so you actually get paid less per traveler the larger the territory you have, even though you have to put in more time and effort to achieve goals. Additionally, the benefits used to be great, but EF has not really kept up with the pace of other companies. Good/inexpensive health insurance and 3-4 weeks vacation is pretty standard these days. \r\n \r\nGoals:\r\n\u2022\tGoals are completely arbitrary and based on minimum 10% growth as a company. Unfortunately, the bigger you grow and the more travelers you add, you are expected to continue to grow on top of that for coming years. I was told time and time again that my goals were high because they \"thought I could do it\" rather than backed by any real data, even when I asked for it. The only data they were able to provide was \"past performance\" and \"where we want it to be.\" Directors are essentially given a goal for the team to then spread out among their team based on who they think will perform and frankly who they like. \r\n \r\nManagement:\r\n\u2022\tI honestly feel bad for most directors/managers because their hands are tied by upper management who generally has no clue what they are doing. I think it's a huge red flag when most of your VPs &amp; Executives have only worked at one company in their decades long careers. Often you would ask why things were done the way they were done and the response is \"that's how it's always been\" which is not a valid business reason. Additionally, management is taught that loyalty and positivity (often toxic) is valued more than transparency and performance, which is then expected of their reps at all costs. When I would express interest in another role or leaving the company, I was met with guilt tripping and trash talking of other organizations which ultimately placed doubt in the decision to pursue other options. Even when applying for internal roles, I was told \u201cyou know you\u2019re going to take a huge pay cut\u201d or \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to be very challenged in that role.\u201d Very manipulative considering that the majority of the workforce at EF is straight out of college and doesn't have the experience to know that they don't deserve to be treated this way in a professional environment. During my time at EF, I witnessed over half of my fellow employees be driven to tears by management. There is no real time or place for employees to give feedback about management, and even if there was, nothing ever gets done with it. \r\n \r\nProduct:\r\n\u2022\tThere is no doubt that there is value in travel, and everyone that works at EF will agree with that. However, the poor quality of the tour experience gets very hard to justify when your customers are having bad experiences over and over again. There's nothing worse than pulling up to a hotel on your staff tour to see an advertised price of 25 euro per room outside when you're charging kids on average $3500 for a trip. Oh and mind you, there's 4 kids in that 25 euro room. Same with meals, when the menu lists the same meal for $8 and they paid significantly more than that. Not everything is bad, but it gets exhausting to have to tell customers that \"their expectations were too high\" when you can hardly stomach the dirty hotels and mediocre food yourself. \r\n \r\nMy advice for anyone looking at working at EF is to stay realistic and don't get pulled into the expectations of something greater. Go into it with the mentality that you'll have fun, get bomb sales training, and see the world but that is it. Get out within 2 years and get yourself a sales job with earning and growth potential. If you heed this advice and don't fall into the trap of thinking opportunity is just on the horizon, you'll save yourself a lot of unnecessarily expended energy and time.",

They are a company that truly values their workforce and makes sure you are properly trained. Coming in with zero sales experience, I have had consistent coaching and support that has really allowed me to grow as an employee and open doors for advancement. Because of this job I have been able to see the world and establish a strong network of incredible people. Also, the parties and lingo (work bar) are pretty cool too!",
