This approach to leadership significantly impacted the workplace atmosphere and employee well-being, with little consideration given to the personal health or circumstances of the team members. Despite facing health issues, employees often felt unsupported and undervalued, leading to a widespread sentiment of dissatisfaction among the staff. Additionally, the job market for Salesforce developers in Budapest appears constrained, adding to the employees' frustrations. Concerns were also raised about the broader implications of hiring practices on local employment opportunities. It's important for prospective employees to consider these factors when evaluating potential employment opportunities within this company.",
