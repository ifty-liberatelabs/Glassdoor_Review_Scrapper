                        "cons": "-They expect you to get way too much work done in way too short of a time. work-life balance horrible.\r\n-Pay is super sketchy- cash with no pay stub or any other record for you.\r\n-The provided apartments (that you're \"strongly encouraged\" to accept) are frequently in disrepair or substandard condition. There is a handyman who will repair things, but he has to come by pretty frequently. Oh, and he can drop by your apartment any time unannounced if management decides to so a spot inspection.\r\n-Utilities for the provided apartments are 350-450 yuan a month per person. I have since learned that this amount is more than double what utilities should cost for an entire apartment, yet they're collecting that amount from each person in the 2 or 3 bedroom apartments. That means someone is skimming money off the teachers and keeping it for themselves. This amount is deducted from your base pay of 7000 yuan each month (which is already quite low compared to market) before you get it.\r\n-There is a 2 months notice policy if you wish to leave your contract early, instead of the standard 30 days.\r\n-One of the schools in my area was heavily fined by the government within the past year for charging parents a different amount that was on the invoice.\r\n-Recent managerial changes have resulted in some sort of power play and turf war between managers, and it seems like the battle revolves around who can micro-manage their teachers the most. Not even 6 months ago corporate gave us the New High Fliers program, a fancy new curriculum designed by people from Cartoon Network. It's awesome. However, new management has decided that we have to disregard the provided lesson plans and rewrite every single lesson to conform to an overly strict and honestly impossible scaffolding schedule. It calls for more minutes than are in the class. Instructions are confusing at best and outright conflicting at worst. We have to fit in eight 5-10 minute fun activities per hour of class time, yet we're not allowed to play what has been deemed as \"crazy games\" but not yet defined as what that includes. On top of all that, we have to write out our lesson plans on specific paper with every step and timing nuance included, and they can be spot inspected at any time.\r\n-On the administration side, the focus is on money. Many of the course coordinators do not actually care about the English level of the student or what is best for them, instead shoving students into whatever available class they think is the closest, just so as to make the sale. It causes a lot of stress and frustration.\r\n-Communication between departments is horrible. You'll be scheduled for events and they'll forget to tell you about it (or actually put it on your schedule) until it starts and you don't show up. Or, they'll suddenly decide to take one of your classes and put a different teacher in charge of it without warning for no discernible reason.\r\n-There is definite favoritism and despotism in the office, where friends of the higher managers get treated much differently.",
