At EF, over 60% of our managers are women, so we certainly don't identify with a patriarchal approach. We offer ongoing manager training and opportunities for staff to provide feedback about senior leaders so that we can continue to provide development for people at all levels of the organization. I'm sorry that you didn't feel this effort coming through in your experience. We do appreciate the feedback and, as always, will use this as a chance to improve.",
