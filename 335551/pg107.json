We promote staff into management roles early in their careers because we believe they can meet their teams\u2019 high expectations of them.  But we\u2019ve also heard feedback that managers crave more support and training, which has been a major focus over the last year. In addition to the ongoing support and mentorship that managers receive from their product\u2019s leadership team, managers now also have the opportunity to participate in weekly manager coaching sessions; monthly manager training workshops; bi-monthly manager nuts and bolts trainings; and bi-annual new manager training conferences. We\u2019ll continue to focus on giving our managers the tools they need to lead high performing teams.\r\n-- Mike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
