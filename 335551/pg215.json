The central offices in Z\u00fcrich and London anppear to be obscenely lavish when compared to the state to which they allow their schools to degenerate before, seemingly, grudgingly investing. Teachers are hugely undervalued, with graduate status being a requirement to be hired, but wages far below what you would make on a supermarket till. Spaces in the London School were taken over by national management teams to the expense of decent office space being made available to teachers. We had a number of different directors most of whom rarely took the time to speak to the academic team. There was never any gesture of recognition for those of us who taught through lockdown and kept the company afloat whilst others sat on on furlough getting paid 80% of their wages whilst working other full-time jobs and actually doing very nicely out of furlough which, particularly when you take into account London living costs felt insulting and thoughtless.",
