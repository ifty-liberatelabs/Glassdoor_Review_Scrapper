Yes, they'll say that you can do writing corrections, but it's still feels like a waste of time, and you have to be FAST at the corrections. \r\nTComplaint number 3, or is it 4? The slides used for lessons are lame. Sorry I can't think of a better word, but they just didn't seem helpful for the student or easy to use for me.\r\nFrom the start, I have felt underpaid, underappreciated, and underworked.
