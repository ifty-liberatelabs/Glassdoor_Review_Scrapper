This is what I wanted, but after the position ended I learned this was a lie. I was only hired because they needed someone immediately, and figured they could take advantage since I wanted a full time job. I was not paid until two months after the assignment ended, and was told it was because my supervisor was on vacation - so I guess if your boss goes on vacation you just don't get paid? Overall, very disappointing experience and management was extremely disrespectful when I voiced my concerns over pay. Do not work for them, they may seem great but there's a reason why they have a huge turnover rate for employees. This position set me back in my overall job search by close to two months, because of the time spent working as well as the numerous emails, phone calls, and texts that went unanswered with valid concerns. Such disrespectful etiquette for supposed professionals.",
