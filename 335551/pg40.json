I've yet to figure out why they favorite some people over others for management roles. I think it's the people that don't ask for raises or speak out against decisions that the leaders of the company make.

Tuition reimbursement for classes and conferences has been, and continues to be, an important tool for staff to take advantage of external training and development opportunities that fit their needs and interests.

If I didn't enjoy the job, and if the lesson content wasn't created for you, there is no way I would stay here.\r\nThis is more of a personal con, but sometimes I overschedule myself or see a sub available and take it, and then I burn out.
