The relative free reign EF bosses seem to enjoy in China is not going to last - Since the pandemic china is pushing back hard with regulations. If you do not regulate yourself and hold petty western bosses to account then the nation is going to do so by whatever draconian means.",

                        "cons": "2) Racist Management and Culture - It became a common trend where Black teachers were passed over promotions despite being there for years. Most that I knew left frustrated after investing years and never being given the recognition they deserved. My boss told me I looked like \"the dog from the simpsons\" because I had \"shifty eyes\" My only interaction with this guy until then had been shaking hands and saying pleased to meet you. Maybe I was a bit shy? Another Black teacher was constantly gossiped about as being rude and sassy. I heard all about her before I even met her. When I finally did meet her, I found one of the loveliest people I'd ever met. \r\n3) EF does not care about you. They will bring you across the world and drop you like a hat if you struggle to acclimatize in your first month. In my case, they admitted to messing up with finding an apartment for me (usually a range have to be identified ahead of time, because when foreigners just show up looking for homes, the letting agencies are dishonest and want to scam you by pawning off substandard apartments) I ended up with a roach infested apartment. That and being in a new environment contributed to skin infections all over my body. Before I had the chance to address what was the issue - I was fired 3 weeks in to landing in this new continent. Now I was underperforming, and these might be generally permissible grounds for termination in our home countries - But EF is dragging out fresh graduates to a different continent where they don't know anyone outside of the company. I had to go to the hospital 3 times in my first month there. After I was fired, they accompanied me once to the hospital and then withdrew all support. Luckily, Chinese staff were always lovely to me and one accompanied me to translate of his own accord. Though I was alone and devastated, with not even enough money for a plane home, I got lucky and met a lot of helpful people, my health cleared in a month, and I started a new job with a higher salary right after.\r\n4) EF (in Chongqing) has a toxic culture of bullying. After I was fired, again just for general underperformance, I of course wanted to stay in touch with the people I'd met - All fellow EF employees. All the people I knew in this country. For the most part, except for Black teachers and teachers in other schools, everyone started avoiding me. I started hearing wild, demonizing rumors about my behavior. They became more and more absurd. A year later I'd still be hearing these rumors. I'd get dirty looks from teachers at my former school - even teachers who joined AFTER I left. In a city where EF is one of the biggest employers of foreigners, this petty high school rumor culture is a lot more toxic, and frankly pathetic and unprofessional. Since I was undergoing a crisis at this time, I reached out to my recruiter and he lashed out with an abusive email, accusing me of more rumors' and telling me not to contact him. Sure, it's not his job anymore and he's frustrated that I reflect poorly on him. But he should either be capable of balancing the company\u2019s version of the events with the individuals version of events and offering some light counsel as a human being, or should just have ignored me. What I heard from other teachers is that there is a culture of telling teachers not to talk to those who have been let go. 6 months after the fact, my recruiter was visiting Chongqing and had dinner with some of his recruits. A few were my friends. He asked if they knew me and started ranting about me. Why? Because I got sick and under performed? Is that really warranted? It's gross and pathetic behavior, especially when the expat community is so small. These people seem to think they can control their little expat ghettos. If they let you go, they want you GONE from the country, so as to not join the competition. I met one of the bosses in a burger place and he saw me and spoke my name on its own like a headmaster. He stared. He Ignored the Black teacher next to me who was actually currently his employee. Same guy had a reputation for bullying Chinese staff, shouting tirades - Because they will take it. China is a wonderful place where a lot of sad, disreputable foreigners come to power trip. Often it's these people who stick around the longest and rise to positions of power within the hierarchy. Most of them are nothing where they came from, and they never will be. EF represents the worst of corporate culture, and seems to be worse for being expat oriented and in China. Structures that may help workers to hold their employers to account, to hold them responsible, simply do not exist for foreigners in China.",
