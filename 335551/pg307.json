It\u2019s great to hear that you like the flexible hours and that the content is already created for you.\nJust like most teaching positions, learners are working their way through a syllabus, which of course runs on a cycle. It\u2019s understandable that after teaching for a while, that some may find the content boring, but we hope that teachers will see that each class is different, regardless of content, because it\u2019s the teacher and learner personalities that bring the content to life. Having this repetition also creates opportunity for teachers to teach lessons trying different approaches, so hopefully you and your students have benefitted from this. \nWith regards to pay, there is a partial payment for when students don\u2019t show if teachers stay in the class for 15 minutes and mark the ACR as a \u2018No Show\u2019 for the grade and note the No Show in the section \u2018For Teachers Only.\u2019",
