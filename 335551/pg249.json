We understand how hard teachers work and are constantly looking for ways to promote and support a healthy work-life balance. For example, we try to give our teachers the opportunity to attend sponsored social and cultural events and provide a number of development opportunities and programs to assist with many of the daily challenges of teaching. In April and May we are sponsoring a health fair in our major cities with a focus on physical and mental health. These are just some examples of initiaitves to promote a balanced and healthy lifestyle for our teachers. We take any allegations of discrimination very seriously.

Kids are paying a crazy amount of money for something improvised, but they'll obviously have fun anyway because they're kids and mostly because you are there for them so you don't care if yoi sleep 4 hours and you've been working nonstop, you just give them all of your energy, and they need a lot. You have 1 day off in which they say that you could go on a trip but you'd probably  be so dead inside that you'll spend it laying on the bed in silence. I also had a lot of fun with coworkers, but we were all so stressed and tired that was crazy.",
