Every business line and major function, including the finance organization, has a Recruiting and Employee Development team that serves exactly that purpose as well.  Since the new office opened last spring, we also have a central Recruiting and Employee Development team, which is a resource that staff can utilize when they\u2019d like to seek support outside of their business line.  I am troubled by your accusation that our work and pay practices are not in compliance with legal requirements.  Our management and pay policies and systems are designed to do right by our employees and, of course, comply with legal requirements.  If you have specific information that suggests otherwise, please reach out to your Recruiting &amp; Employee Development representative.",
