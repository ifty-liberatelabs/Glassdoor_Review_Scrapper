I worked at EF for a little over 2 years and never once did management/team directors have an open conversation about development opportunities or career path discussions. I also never had an exit interview which demonstrates how much this \"best place to work\" organization cares about areas of improvement or employee retention. Keep sucking in young adults and spitting them out after they realize they could be happier, better compensated, and supported somewhere else in Boston that actually is a \"best\" place to work.",

Needless to say, it seemed a certain individual had it out for me and decided to take matters into their own hands. I have never been treated with such disrespect before.
