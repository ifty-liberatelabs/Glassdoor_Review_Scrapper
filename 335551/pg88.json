You are tricked into thinking your pay increase (once a year) is incredible when in reality, it's pretty offensive. For new out of college workers, they take advantage of you. \r\n\r\nSince the company is so young, so is management. There is no leadership or people to help you grow and achieve your goals because those that should be managing you are probably a year or so older than you are. It is essentially the blind leading the blind and there is no training AT ALL for management. If you expect to grow within EF and gain a management position, working hard probably will not get you there. What will get you there is politics and throwing your colleagues under the bus. There are great managers within Go Ahead but very minimal who were the managers that convinced me to stay around as long as I did. \r\n\r\nThe turnover rate is ridiculous. Being an employee for three years, I have seen dozens of people quit or get pushed out. Outside of pay, most people leave because they realize there is no future for them, management does not have your back and communication between departments and management is dreadful.\r\n\r\nIf you are a recent grad, go for it.
