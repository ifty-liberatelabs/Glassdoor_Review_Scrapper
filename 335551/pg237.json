A territory owner manages key accounts and is looked on as \u201cleaders\u201d on the team. As a prospector (more common for new tour consultants) you are relying on cold calls and the occasional lead from the website to find new business. You are mainly prospecting in schools that the territory owner you are working with does not want or has burned too many bridges at. Depending on the market, you can find some success but management will push you to contact extremely low-income schools and convince them to pay copious amounts of money for a tour. \r\n- the best way to get on a manager\u2019s good side is to get drunk with them at the office\r\n- no HR department, instead is rebranded as \u201cPeople and Culture\u201d with a focus on just making everyone happy to be working a low paying job\r\n- if you aren\u2019t overworking yourself, you will not grow within the company\r\n- Very little diversity in the office.
