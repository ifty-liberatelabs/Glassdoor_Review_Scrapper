Yes, it might cost a tad more, but you are also going to bring in better and bigger sales.  Don't overload your employees with call amounts and sales numbers and meetings...remember the salary they are getting and try to be respectful of that.  I know you are running a business, but these people live in an expensive city and are working very hard for the company.  Beer at desks...come on that is just tacky! (and cheap beer at that!)",

I have no fear of hard work and I was able to get the highest salary increase each year, but was still far below the market average for a sales position requiring such demands.  The company will expect you to work overtime...and you will probably do a lot of it.  It is hard to move out of the phone sales position...I worked my butt off for a year and made it to another position, but I was one of the lucky few.  Then when the economy hit, they removed most of the non-sales positions and I found myself selling again.\r\nThe turnover rate is very, very high given the low rate of pay and office stress level.  You are working directly with teachers...who can really be quite crazy!  You will get a lot of experience from this job, but it will not necessarily translate onto your resume...but, it will be something you can carry with you for future jobs.\r\nSometimes it took all my willpower to walk through the doors in the morning.",

These are two significant areas I have realized that EF (Educational tours division) fails its employees:\r\n\r\n1. Management does not stick to development plan advertised to new employees:\r\nWhen you join this organization, it is advertised that your first year on the job will be spent learning and growing in the role, and that there is room for error as you learn the skills necessary. This is not followed through by management. This was my first job after graduating from University. I was given a territory to manage my first day out of training (not the norm). There was no additional training provided even though being a territory manager requires a whole slew of new skills and knowledge than being a sales associate (the position you go through a month of training for). I started feeling overwhelmed at being thrust in to a new job I essentially was not trained for. instead of being met with understanding, I was told by my boss that I was not a good fit for the job, nor would I be a good fit for any job I was interested in afterwards (despite exceeding my goals for the quarter). I wish this situation was exclusive only to me, but I have seen good, hard working people either straight up fired or bullied (for lack of a better word) in to resigning by their manager even though there were no conduct issues at play. They just didn't \"get it\" right away or were deemed not a \"cultural fit\". When you are a young, 22 year old recent college grad, events like this can wreck your self esteem. I didn't do everything perfectly, but I still came in and worked hard, and no one deserves to be told what I was told by their manager. I will be fair and state this was not the case for a majority of employees. However, from an employee development standpoint,the treatment that the select few I mentioned received was frankly appalling. Thankfully I learned not to take what he said to heart and have had a great and meaningful career since leaving. \r\n\r\n2. The compensation is insultingly low. Unfortunately many employees are fresh college grads, and do not have the experience in the workforce to know this. I was regularly putting in 50 hours a week. However, the bonus program for sales professional was anemic compared to other performance based pay in other sales fields. The only thing that offsets this is the paid travel opportunities.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this has an impact on customer retention. I remember being told by one of my Group Leaders (customers), \"People Keep Leaving over there. It makes me think 'what is going on with EF?' Please don't leave for a long time\". Ultimately, when I left for the reasons stated above, I had to break it to her and felt her frustration. Having TCs come and go every 6 months does not create trust in your customers.\r\n\r\nI wrestled with whether or not to submit this review, but I wish I had known what the managers there are capable of when I was entertaining this workplace. It took two years removed from there to realize just how problematic the behaviors by management I witnessed were. You don't have that context as a 22 year old recent college grad. If I can save one person from experiencing what I experienced then I think it would be worth it.",
