The host families that you use are disgusting, but when you are told this you say EF can't be picky. You put money before everything else including student happiness and staff. What is more shocking is that you failed your ISI inspection in October 2017 and only just passed the follow up in April 2018. Yet you have not declared this on your website, or to parents.
