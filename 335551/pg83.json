As so many before me have said, value employees more with better salary and expectations on the tour consultant role. \r\n\r\nSales is not fair, life is not fair, but goals should not be arbitrary numbers that directors get to choose based on how they feel about a salesperson that day.\r\n\r\nIf retention of your employees does not matter to you, great! Pitch the position as a 1-2 year opportunity to learn sales skills, make new friends, drink beers and travel a bit. Stop pitching the idea that you care about the professional development and career progression of your your tour consultants.",

You will likely respond with a comment about how there is 'bonus potential determined by the sales growth and market potential of my territory'. To that I say, WRONG. The sales goals are arbitrary numbers that directors create, many times that are based on how much they like or dislike you. For context, I was liked by my director and the top performer on my team, exceeding sales goals by double digits. Sold nearly $4 mill in a single year, but made under $55k. I was told by my director that \"I was getting a good deal from EF\" when I received my well deserved bonus check a month late 3 times.\r\n\r\nCurrently pushing sales people to leave the organization because it is cheaper for them to push them out then pay their severance packages when they fire them in the coming months.\r\n\r\nTo my friends who are still there-- I hope you are able to open your eyes to what MORE is out there professionally for you. There is so much amazing sales talent at EF and I wish I could shake each of you to encourage you to go unlock your full potential elsewhere (while making the salary you deserve!)\r\n\r\nAnd it is not just about the money. I could go on about the lack of diversity, cliquey culture, office politics, profit driven mission, poor quality product and senior management that lacks empathy for their employees, but I will digress...",
