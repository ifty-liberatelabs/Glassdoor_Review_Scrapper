Probably if management has been better, people would be more willing to overlook that they are being paid less, but that wasn't the case.

Sometimes it feels like it's run by children or under qualified people. The online materials are sometimes difficult to navigate through and not located together, on top of the many dead links and useless files/folders that are there. Horrible programming.\r\n\r\nThe overall expectations of you as a teacher also reach greater and greater heights without increasing your pay. They will fill your schedule with classes and tasks, school visits and promotions to the point where your classes will lose their quality because of the lack of time. You will have to start preparing classes at home without pay if you still want to make decent lesson plans.\r\n\r\nThe pay is also something that needs to be addressed.

This means you feel pressurised and often have no idea what is coming up in the lesson.\r\n- The lesson content is also really difficult to follow when you have limited time to prepare for what you're going to teach. The target language for the lesson can only be found on one or two particular pages and there's no way that teachers can look ahead or check the teacher notes on other slides during the lesson.\r\n- They operate a bonus system based entirely on student ratings for the lessons you teach.
