However,  the training modules are filled with slides that has verbiage similar to \"this doesn't apply anymore\" or \"this function is there but the interface may look different\". It's impossible to know what teaching an actual class is like.\r\n\r\nThe other con is the teacher mentor process. A new teacher is assigned a mentor that has taught and worked with the company for several years. My mentor was pretty worthless. The problem is they are teaching classes, too and they have other jobs. So, trying to contact them is very hard and they do not have a lot of tech experience; so if you need help with navigating the online classroom (which has tons of issue: bad audio, queues that do not connect or fail) they can't help  you. Lastly, the teacher mentors are not proactive, they do not check on you or help you teach your first class.\r\n\r\nAlso, the technology is very hit or miss with the classroom set up. The company has a great mission statement, but the internal workings do not match. They need a new learning and development process including real teacher mentors and a tech help desk.",

When I asked for a reason for my firing, I was given no response, and had the police called on me. The center director lied to the officer and told them I attacked her. There were cameras all over the center that refuted her claim. The officer escorted me back to my hotel and from there I coordinated with my family to get a return flight booked. I have heard no follow up from this company since my unlawful firing. I spent a great deal of money and time preparing for this teaching position and overseas move, and to have that completely disregarded after working with this company for such a short period of time was extremely disappointing.
