And we wholeheartedly agree that an individual parents\u2019 comment doesn\u2019t necessarily make for a bad teacher, it could just be the fit. When we receive such feedback, we simply allow customers the flexibility to take lessons with another teacher that might be better suited.\nWe do really appreciate this feedback, thanks again for sharing.",
