If you would focus on your academic product as your number one priority, start retaining students and teachers, sales and business growth would follow naturally. You are putting the cart in front of the horse by driving your business with sales, and along the way you are chewing up and spitting out teachers and students.",

                        "cons": "Overall work culture: I guess my single biggest piece of advice is to teachers and people who really care about the work they are doing. EF is a PRIVATE education company that is completely fixated on MONEY, not the kids they are teaching. 2 facts backing that up: 1) In my city, our new students sales revenue greatly outweighed our continuing students revenue. (ie. students don't stay with EF) 2) Teachers are constantly asked and expected to do sales oriented work like demo lessons and encourage parents to buy other courses during Parent Teacher Meetings.   So if you are concerned with growing as a teacher and wanting to be in a place where you can really help your students in a meaningful way, EF is not the place for you, and there are great international schools and other schools that would love to hire a dedicated teacher. \r\nManagement: The management pool in my city was frankly very mediocre. Many people are promoted to management because they've been too lazy or unmotivated to move on and find themselves in a position of seniority very quickly as a result of the insanely high turnover rate.  The management I encountered for the most part was inexperienced and unprofessional, often choosing office favorites, openly disrespecting some staff members, and morally weak. \r\nOther big negative: I hated feeling pressure to compromise my morals while working for this company to do things like lie about my experience level as a teacher, lie about why we needed to change teachers for a class, or try to sell course I didn't think would realistically help the student I was selling to. \r\nCompensation: Compared to other options available, EF was paying us about 30% to 40% less than what I could easily find elsewhere in the city. During the summer months, there is an increase in hours and work that has no extra compensation given for it. \r\nThere's more, but this is already long enough. My strongest advice after locking myself into a contract for 15 months and struggling through it is: Look elsewhere before accepting. There are other, genuinely much better options! Especially once you are on the ground in the country you want to be in, English teachers are in HIGH demand, you don\u2019t need to settle for EF.",

When you\u2019re given your group there is no order at all, there\u2019s loads of kids walking around this centre and you have no idea if they\u2019re in your group or not, and neither do they, so how the hell are you supposed to find them? \r\n\r\nLuckily I managed to get most of my students in one place, mostly by shouting their names out like I was at a meat market haggling for more pigs. Once I had found them, we have less than 5 minutes to get to a coach which was a far walk away, and no where near the centre - WHY \r\n\r\nYou have no time to learn names, or who these kids are - you just get straight on a bus with a scrappy little piece of paper vaguely telling you where to go. It\u2019s terrible. \r\n\r\nOnce I got to the location, there was just a mass of kids from other groups or dallying about in the road, to which the other activity leaders didn\u2019t seem to give a toss. Then in the blinding heat you have to look at this poorly printed piece of paper with a map that looks like it was drawn by a 2 year old and somehow lead these poor kids through the to the mall, in a certain time frame AND also playing games with them along the way and learning all their names. How the hell does this work? \r\n\r\nThen once you get to the mall, I hope you enjoy taking money from children because that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be doing here. Instead of them wandering around the mall and having fun, you have to explain to these children why they need to give you upwards of 150 euros to go on certain activities, some of which didn\u2019t even know they had to pay, and some flat out seemed upset and confused that I was asking for their money when I\u2019d only just met them. It resorted to me sitting on the floor, 20 kids huddled around me, some confused and handling large stacks of cash, with the whole world to see. Not to mention COVID. Then where do you put that money you ask? Just put it all in your backpack! It\u2019s fine! No one is going to rob you or see you put nearly 1000 euros in your backpack at all! WTF\r\n\r\nThen to top it all off, most of the kids had no clue where they staying, and it was a fight to figure out with the obnoxious bus driver who was going where. It was shockingly terrible. Where the hell is health and safety?\r\n\r\nOh, and all this? \u20ac250. Not. Worth. It.",

If teachers received lesson planning hours at the start of the day it would better instead of a class as soon as they arrive at the center.\r\n\r\n6) There advice is obvious but I would recommend hiring teachers that pronounce English better. Dwee is not the same pronunciation as THree.",
                        "adviceOriginal": null,
                        "cons": "1) The company has been going through constant change over the past year and a half. There have been three different CEO's, the first was Peter Winn, followed by Bill Fisher and now a new one. This constant change leads to new management structures being introduced every time a new CEO is brought in. This leads to the whole company being shaken all the way down to the lowest levels.\r\n\r\n2) Another major change for the Adult centers in China has been the removal of a Director of Studies(DoS) at all centers to be replaced with just one or two for each city. The responsibilities of the DoS have been turned over to Center Managers, who have no teaching experience and sometimes limited English ability. This places teachers in a compromised situation, in that they now lack an experienced leader in their field to rely on and to ask for advice. It also compromises teachers by putting the teaching team under the direct control of the individual who main concern is profit and not education. One of the last pieces of advice being tossed around carelessly at EF Adult centers in China was \"Let's make it a circus in the classroom.\" This show the lack of commitment towards educating the students and more towards a commitment to entertain them.\r\n\r\n3) Another con with EF in China is that when a center is not doing well or could do better they do not want to hear any constructive ideas on how to improve the center. The management does not do well when it is questioned on new ideas and plans they present to the staff and teachers. If constructive ideas are presented to the management which are not in accordance with the upper management, then that person will quickly find that their position in the company is to follow and obey not to think.\r\n\r\n4) EF used to attempt to develop their staff and teachers with a weekly meeting where new ideas would be introduced and taught to the teachers and staff. This was labelled CPD and it was mandatory for all teachers to attend these meeting weekly and were placed on days which all teachers were present. This is no longer the case. Management has done this through removing Directors of Studies and making it the responsibility of teachers to attend training on their off days. In removing the Director of Studies they removed the main educator of the teachers. They have  replaced the Director of Studies with some center teachers and labelled them as trainers, even though they do not have the credentials the position should require. These trainers now have the responsibility of training teachers with prepared Power Point Presentations and teaching the allotted 25 hrs a week. Also the trainers offer the training on a specific day of the week. If you are off that day then you should come in on your off day to attend training. This effectively means the teachers are now working 6 days a week instead of 5 days a week.\r\n\r\n5) Teachers are burning out faster at EF than at other companies. Teachers at EF teach the contracted 25hrs of a 45hr work week that is in the contract but on top of this have many other duties that they must attend to which include 2-3 hrs/week doing oral testing for new students, 2-3 hrs/week doing lounge chats, 5 hrs/week to plan all lessons and to write new classes for life clubs (most teachers spend more time on their off days creating materials for their classes as EF does not allow for more time at work to do this). On top of this the teachers must do their own development during hours that could be better spent on correcting homework, creating class materials or completing feedback for students.\r\n\r\n6) Recruitment of teachers. The on-line materials, specifically the on-line classes, that EF use usually recruits teachers from non-native English speaking countries such as India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The reason for this is that they are cheaper than teachers from Native speaking countries. The main problem with this is that native English speaking teachers in the centers then have to correct the pronunciation errors being taught to the students.",
