The new contract stipulates that you must work overtime in certain seasons with no overtime pay. Additionally, (in my case) I had to agree to pay them around 6,000 USD (2-4 months salary) of my own money if I quit without giving them 4 months notice.\r\n\r\nYou may be  facing discrimination, harassment, health problems, or are simply trapped during an epidemic like COVID-19. And then your ability to leave that country is completely at the mercy of your boss. They may or may not let you leave. \r\n\r\nParents observe several lessons per term, and rate them on a scale of 1-10. Anything less than perfect is considered unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory lessons are replayed (everything you do is recorded by cameras in the classroom) during ACD meetings with all the other teachers. In order to make you recognize mistakes, they regularly humiliate teachers and pit them against one another in meetings. Additionally, many female teachers at the school I taught at were asked to publicly preform a suggestive dance at a work conference, and were required to wear short skirts to do so. These practices continue because they can get away with it. They're wealthy and they prey on young people wanting to live abroad. They count on the fact that you don't speak the language around you, and that you can't leave for fear that they'll demand a sum of (in my case) $6,000.",
