Managers are cool and generally supportive, but don't offer too much direction on a day-to-day basis. Taking matters into your own hands sometimes means that you will have wasted time on something nobody is going to use\u2014which is why networking and listening are key skills to develop within the company. \r\n\r\nIf you're a newbie to EF, it'll take 1 or 2 years to get used to how things work and know intuitively who to ask for this-and-that. This kind of company might not work for those looking for something structured, with a familiar corporate hierarchy\u2014one reason the turnover is so high. Corporate mentorships don't exist at all; it's on you to find your own mentor. My word of advice if you're looking to get hired by EF: make sure that you know someone WELL within the company before doing so. A friend at the beginning of your time here will help you get acquainted with all of this company's quirks double-time and cut down on the time you spend dazed and confused; he or she will be infinitely more helpful than a mentor will be.",

They spend all day walking, talking and eating as they feel safe in their jobs due to it being given to them for the sole reason of being friends or family with the people dictating who to employ for these roles. \r\n\r\nStop hiring and promoting people that add no value and start hiring the people you need. It is such a shame that a company that could be great simply has no motivation to be so. It is a toxic environment to work with bullying, corruption, harassment, nepotism and a seriously poor levels of management and humane capabilities.

You will see them laughing and chatting together, having their coffees and snacks all day, walking the corridors with their laptops in hand pretending they actually have somewhere to be and something to do. The joke is to book a meeting room and just go there to take a nap. No one will ever question anything you do because no one really cares. \r\n\r\nAnother issue in EF is that it will not matter how good you are at what you do or what you are capable of unless you are friends or family of management. You will not advance and all the jobs are given based on who you know and how good you are at not questioning, not bothering, not caring all that much. The goal is to look busy enough that no one will call up on you and at the same time keep to yourself whenever you see something you can change or that you conceive is wrong. Silence and complicity will get you to the top in EF, not commitment and development. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this leads the majority of the employees in charge of the different teams' progress being utterly useless and idle. This is affecting the company's trajectory and it has gone from a profit multiplying company to a sinking ship as the majority of management lacks the intelligence and drive required for their job. A good ethical person will quit as soon as they understand their efforts are in vain, people will join EF thinking it is a big company and will blindly give themselves to overtime (not paid), multiple business trips, unnecessary meetings while they are \u201cunder the spell\u201d i.e. while they believe they can make a difference and change something. As soon as the 2 to 3 years mark hits, it is like a fog lifting from the air and the good ones will either burn-out and leave or they will just leave to travel for months on end to cleanse their soul. \r\n\r\nWith all this, the environment has become toxic as the higher ups do not work but expect a wage, resulting in the exploitation of lower paid staff (usually just out of college kids) that must cover excessive workloads generated by poor organisation. You will be expected to sit in front of a computer screen for hours on end and managers and trainees will end up spending anywhere from 2-6 hours at a time in front of a computer screen. It is frowned upon to actually take your breaks and arrive and leave on time, this will convey the message that you do not go the \u201cextra mile\u201d; even your own peers will judge you as they are too scared to disagree with the puppet directors. \r\n\r\nFinally, the majority of higher roles are filled in with people that are unable to speak English properly, and in an international market, this is essential.",

English Online constituted more stable employment, a better rate of pay and the end of unpaid work (marking exams, lesson planning, data entry).\r\n\r\nIt took 6-8 months to feel really comfortable with it, but since then I've felt very comfortable in the online classroom. The pattern of teaching for 40-45 minutes and having the rest of the hour to complete an evaluation form is sustainable. Other online platforms offer much shorter breaks, and the accumulated stress takes its toll eventually, even if they pay a bit better.\r\n\r\nI am able to develop good relationships with one-on-one students, sometimes up to 100 classes over more than a year. It is difficult to get that kind of student loyalty working as an independent teacher.\r\n\r\nTeachers are paid via Payoneer, which works well. I am able to send money to my bank account in my home country or the country where I live. Payoneer seems to charge for currency exchange but not for a simple transaction in USD. It may be a good idea to set up your own Payoneer account before you add English Live as a payee, in order to have the full range of payment options.\r\n\r\nA few times, I have tried to move to other platforms and it didn't work out. English Live has allowed me to return to my old job on each occasion.",

                        "cons": "- The salary is quite low in comparison to other jobs, especially in your first year when paying off the housing loan. While I was earning less than 12,000 yuan (\u00a31340) per month, I was constantly seeing friends and former colleagues getting paid 20,000 + for the same job at other schools. \r\n\r\n- Poor communication is a big problem at EF. Often we would be told we had to attend trainings or teach classes with minimal notice. The language barrier between foreign and local staff could also be frustrating. Some members of the sales team had very poor English which made it difficult to convey messages to them and ask for their help unless we could speak Chinese, which the vast majority of foreign teachers cannot. \r\n\r\n- Our free time was often not taken into consideration. As I previously mentioned, last minute trainings or events could be scheduled whenever the company felt like it and we just had to oblige, regardless of if we had already made plans or even if it was our day off. Once I was handed a written warning because I refused to attend a training that was being held not only on my day off but on my birthday. Sometimes it feels like we are seen as teaching machines rather than human beings.\r\n\r\n- The \u2018summer course\u2019, where we work 6 days a week teaching additional courses on top of regular courses, is a terrible experience. The little free time we have left on our one day off is spent recovering from the exhausting work schedule of endless classes. This goes on for almost two months during the summer period. I noticed not only is it exhausting for teachers, but the students would become tired of wasting their whole summer holiday in the classroom rather than spending it with family and friends. After this experience, I decided I would leave the following year before having to go through it again.\r\n\r\n- They are obsessed with money, sales and retention. The thing about training centres is they are not proper schools, they are businesses. Their goal is to make profit and to retain students in order to continue making profit. This often comes at the expense of teachers, sales staff, and the students themselves. We would be told to place students in classes too difficult for them out of scheduling convenience or because parents wouldn\u2019t pay if their kids weren\u2019t placed in the highest grade possible.",

Variety and constant change is something I need in the workplace and EF can provide that.\r\n\r\n- Making friends from across the world is something you can\u2019t do in most workplaces, but working as an English teacher abroad I made friends from the US and UK, Canada, South Africa, Russia, Poland, New Zealand, and many other countries. The expat scene is China is a rich and diverse melting pot which I was grateful to be a part of.\r\n\r\n- During weekdays you have a significant amount of free time  since the work day is only from 3-8.30pm. You can do whatever you want during the morning and early afternoon. Weekends are not so fun since you\u2019re working from 9am-6.30pm it not longer due to unfinished admin. Despite that, I found myself with plenty of free time to lie in, exercise, explore the city, study Chinese and have coffee with friends. \r\n\r\n- China is a great place to be if you want to see Asia. Flights to countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia are very cheap, so within a year you can travel so several different countries without running out of cash.\r\n\r\n- It is a unique and life changing experience. Moving to the other side of the world and mingling with such a diverse group of people is a memorable experience that I won\u2019t regret doing. While the company has it\u2019s flaws, I would still recommend doing this for a short time, thought would not want to stay longer than a year.",

You cannot spend some days in the office and some days at home. The implication was that we would stay at home on Friday/Monday to get a longer weekend. This is poor treatment of staff, who have worked 5+ months independently at home, worked longer hours (even in the case of kurzarbeit), and got more responsibilities.\r\n- Working from office encouraged up until the day after Fed Gov recommended otherwise in Oct -- despite rising cases both in Zurich and within the office.\r\n- Constantly told by owners and top management that our priorities are with our customers. This is what we are paid to do, we know, but please show compassion to your employees who are also worried about their own health.\r\n\r\nLow pay. No 13th month salary, no bonuses for non-sales staff despite \"best year ever!\". \r\n5 days \"extra\" vacation days to compensate for over time -- basically, you are asked to do unlimited unpaid overtime as needed.\r\nLow benefits, non-existent during covid times.\r\nClear bias in favor of Swedish people\r\nFlat structure so no way to move up on the ladder. Yet decisions come from a couple top management people, middle management cannot stand up for their teams.\r\nNo HR, only Payroll Department which will tell you \"you should discuss with your manager\". No one to go to for complaints, especially if your problem is with your manager. Problems anyway are smiled away due to the forced positiveness of EF.",
