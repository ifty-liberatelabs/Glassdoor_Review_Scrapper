Getting settled into a new environment is really important, and something that we work hard to support, so it\u2019s great when teachers recognize this.\nIt\u2019s interesting that you pointed out the difference in management styles across cultures. It\u2019s great that culture came across, as that\u2019s part of the experience of living and working overseas. While we support international management and different approaches, we do offer regular training and development for managers, to ensure that they manage in a way that represents EFs values.\nWe understand that our compensation packages don\u2019t suit everyone and that they differ from what one can earn at an international school, but we do offer a stable working environment, paid visas and plenty of opportunity for continuous professional development.\nThanks again for sharing balanced feedback on your experience.",
