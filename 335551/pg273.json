Give them real time off and pay them more\r\n\r\n3.  There needs to be a limit during summers, teachers are busy enough so don't give them even more classes without extra pay. Or at least have a limit on summer classes\r\n\r\n4. Give a better budget for Halloween and Christmas events, help the staff who have to walk away from preparing for their class just to decorate and learn to dance.  If EF really does want to maintain its teaching quality then consider all the times that teachers have to do work that's not related to teaching. \r\n\r\n5. Tell us the public holiday dates (new years, national week etc) well in advance and not a week or two before. We all know the dates well ahead of time. Have set dates for the year and don't change them. I can tell you when new years dates are for the next few years using my phone in a matter of minutes!\r\n\r\n6. If EF wants to add more to the curriculum and give more work, then consider finding the right work balance and not just tell them to do more\r\n\r\n7. Regarding technology,  just cause its new doesn't always mean its good. Listen to teachers feedback or at least do a survey for this.\r\n\r\n8. Don't be cheap",

On paper, we work 40 hours but in reality we work a lot longer than that just to plan classes, write progress reports, manage wechat groups and find time to prepare for classes. Sometimes are are too many meetings in one week that takes away time from teachers. \r\n\r\n2. Summer hours are grueling with a 6 day work week and without incentives or extra pay. We have to plan for both summer classes and regular classes. During this time teachers morale usually drops and will look for other employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n3. Halloween and Christmas events are good for the students but bad for teachers, it can be tiring. More hours have to be put in at work just to decorate the entire school and find time to prepare for classes. Teachers have to learn to dance which isn't even part of teaching. The staff spends more time at work during these events and are not paid overtime. Little to no budget just for decorations and costumes that teachers have to buy with their own money. \r\n\r\n4. Teachers are not dancers, not entertainers, not singers and not performers on a stage that's not related to teaching. \r\n\r\n5. We are told at the last minute when public holidays are (new years, national week etc.) and its too late for anyone to plan anything even though  I can tell you when the next holidays are years in advance but EF wont tell you until flight tickets become unaffordable due to the holidays.",
