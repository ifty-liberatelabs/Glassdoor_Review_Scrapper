Patrick should be promoted to lead the department, he's the ONLY person that showed some shred of respect for me as I decided to resign. I felt heard in my exit interview but know all my constructive feedback was not kept or actioned. \n- More base pay.\n- Quand EF Voyages Culturels sera pr\u00eat \u00e0 donner un bon service et une attention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la population francophone, ce serais beaucoup plus agr\u00e9able pour eux de se sentir utile chez EF. Les francophones se sont senti comme de la merde, nous pouvions m\u00eame pas donner \u00e0 nos enseignants les m\u00eames resources que les anglophone car la traduction n'est pas important pour eux. Comment est-ce qu'une entreprise de ventes penses qu'on peut vendre un produit quand le march\u00e9 ne peut m\u00eame pas lire l'information. \n- As a previous employee, I LOVED my job and wish EF would have noticed the passion, given me more opportunities because I would honestly still be working there. The business model is a bit outdated so movers and shakers can't achieve the feeling of satisfaction they could get at any other workplace.",

Education is not leveraged here, it is hard to feel like you add value because the tasks you do have are very procedural and even if you go above and beyond, upper management will strip you of your experiences when looking at career growth. They will say things like, you have to find your own replacement. My apologies but when you raise the bar where it's never been raised, this becomes impossible even though \"Nothing is Impossible\" is a core value. \n- Management is non-existent and the same people get promoted. After 3 years and multiple complaints, it took EF 3 years to change my direct manager. One manager in particular, as we let go of over 50 people, got promoted 3 times into 3 different managerial positions. Then you find yourself having to applaud upper management's decisions when you don't feel good about them. \n- If you're a Yes Man, this is the place for you. EF rewards a culture of sameness by its standards; and gets uncomfortable by people who are movers and shakers. EF hires people based on how well they can assimilate to internal culture. EF does not keep its most passionate workers and doesn't understand that people who are passionate about education and travel, will seek the same opportunities but at a competitor. \n- Pay is well below average. American tour consultants get paid 55,000USD to start and in Canada, it's 37,000. \n- Human Resources need to revamp EVERYONE who works in this department. Some issues that are illegal in nature were brought up to HR and employees were told to look the other way. If you have self-respect and want to work in a healthy environment, this may cause issues.\n- If you are francophone, they will segregate you from the anglophone consultants. They divide everyone and dissolved the only francophone team they had and as a result lost all francophone tour consultants \n- There is no continuity regarding student and teacher success. Stop paying out for useless things and pay your people more, spend less on useless luxuries.",

Think of this as a state of affairs on the workplace so that if you are interested in working here, you can make an informed decision :) \n- Travel is exciting but EF doesn't spark that excitement in its workforce \n- I drew most of my value by building and maintaining relationships with AMAZING educators across the country. I still talk to all of those educators.\n- If you have no friends, EF will provide a roster of people that are friendly\n- Travelling once a year is cool, demanding on the ground but an experience nonetheless \n- Unlimited sick days (depending on your manager, that flexibility is different)\n- Quite generous vacation time compared to other workplaces\n- Travel makes the sales role easier to undertake, no sales experience does not influence how well you do in this position.",
