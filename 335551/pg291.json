You can produce glossy online promotional material and send emails talking about the EF family, however, the low wages and increasing burden placed on teachers suggests \"teachers are not at the heart of everything\". \r\n\r\nConsider explaining the reasons behind policy changes rather than just dumping the new procedure on staff and expecting them to adjust. Changes have been made that make teaching ever more intensive, for example, students can now be on camera in a group lesson. This change  has increased technical difficulties without offering teachers higher pay. We are expected to do more and more, without compensation.  This is a successful company, employing graduates, it can afford to pay teachers more and offer more  teacher-initiated changes.",

                        "cons": "Working from home does offer some freedom and flexibility, however the hours are not guaranteed. If we worked in offices our employer would provide the equipment, pay the heating and lighting and we would benefit from face-to-face interaction with colleagues. This company pays above minimum wage but requires a significant investment from workers, i.e. headphones, strong internet and a comfortable, well-lit home office. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the significant screen time required to earn a living wage is a definite disadvantage. As we are hourly paid, taking breaks is not incentivised, reporting errors in the teaching slides is also unpaid. We are expected to check emails daily, this is unpaid. Preparation is assumed but unpaid. You are expected to arrive early for your class, but you will not be paid. The reports frequently take longer than the allocated time to complete. You will be expected to respond to student emails for free. Training is now paid, however we are encouraged to join online Zoom meetings for free.\r\n\r\nOnline teaching is very demanding. The recent Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated just how draining video conferences can be, now imagine you cannot turn your camera off and you are not paid for those desperately needed breaks away from the screen. \r\n\r\nHowever, the worst aspect is that the teachers have so little control over the teaching materials which are frequently filled with errors. We are also unable to access an entire course or perceive how the different roles interact. Everything is very segmented, you cannot see how the resources are designed, or how the people beyond your role operate. I suspect this is because the company perceives each contractor as a potential competitor. However, it makes teachers feel like intensively farmed animals, churning out classes, trapped in low wage, low autonomy anonymity.",

And with regards to breaks, we do always encourage teachers to take breaks, and while not paid, you are in control of your schedule and can and should plan breaks for yourself.\n\nMandatory teacher training is paid at the UK Centre, regardless of where it is hosted, however optional webinars are not paid, but attendance is encouraged to keep up to date and connected. Regarding our content, we have all content accessible to teachers in the demo room, and where possible, we do share upcoming class lists. \nWe will report your comment on frequent errors to our editorial team and make a conscious effort to get more teacher input when there are product changes, such as the video GL.\n\nThanks again for your feedback.",
