They hire a lot of white recent grads, mostly female, who can survive on $35K a year because their parents help them with rent. There is usually the promise of a bonus if you hit goals that is unreachable for most people. The benefits are fine but standard with other companies, so nothing that can make up for how low they pay.\n\nI've worked here for close to 3 years because I really like my team and made strong connections with some of my group leaders but in retrospect I wasted those years - I could have been making real money and building my resume with transferable skills if I went somewhere else with real job progression. Typically they hire a class of sales people and expect about 1/3 to be let go/quit. Once you hit a peak, they push more onto you until you quit or ask to transfer to another product. Jobs are only available when people leave so you're stuck until someone else quits and you take their place or you quit to work somewhere else. If you stay for 3 years in sales, you're being paid at least $25,000 below what your friends who graduated with you are making elsewhere in sales. Trust me, only work here if you're independently wealthy and don't really want to build a career because your progression will be hindered. \n\nWith COVID, everyone is working from home, so you see that the company culture is built by free drinks and silly costume parties, not diversity and inclusion, transparency, care for mental and physical health, or providing resources to make sure people are doing ok.\n\nGo work at any other Boston companies (Hubspot, Wayfair, Rapid7, Toast, etc), you are guaranteed to be paid more and have more job opportunities.",
