Only 3 or 4 long term teachers become full time permanent staff. Everyone else is paid by the hour and to do a very good job there is a significant amount of unpaid planning/prepping time to be done. (15 min per class only enough to do attendance, not much prepping , etc). They hire mothers, young teachers ,those trying to re-enter the work force or teachers just wanting to work summers. Which is somewhat OK at first due to how wonderful the students and classes can be but there doesn't seem to be much of a path to professional advancement. (unless one transfers out of teaching to another Dept). Classes are consolidated due to enrollment without much if any advance notice to teachers. (and one's class is then suddenly non-existent)....Teachers plan local field trips voluntarily. They can be fulfilling but there really should be some kind of stipend for it.",

They didn't give you enough time for prep either, and only pay $15 for it. They expect you to be able to prep an 80 minute class in only 15 minutes, even though their books are fairly dry and doesn't cover 80 minutes. On top of that, even though I was \"part-time,\" I was working over 40 hours per week in reality. They got away with it by not counting the break time in between classes as \"work\" even though you are physically there prepping for the next class or answering questions. They offered no benefits either. Keep in mind that at a minimum, you need a Bachelors to do this job. Some teachers even had a masters degree. I had to quit because the amount of money that I would pay a daycare to look after my kid was almost the same amount that I would be making here. Not worth it, considering that I had to take a lot of work home grading and checking homework. They expect too much of you but refuse to compensate you fairly. The management is so overworked that they don't even have time to check on their teachers' professional development. As a private company, they care about their bottom line more than anything else and ignore the needs of their employees. If you need a job for a few months, you can try it. Don't stay there too long.",

You are only paid for 6 minutes for each correction about $1.35 depending on your pay grade.  They just instituted computerized quality checks and they are insane. Due to the horrible quality of many of the students writing and many many errors it could take as much as 15 mins to get the quality they want.  They are Quality checked by a computer which does a horrible job.   So if you copy a sentence into your comment (in \"quotes\") to show a student an example of an error and then how to write it correctly,  you are marked down for having spelling errors in  your comment.   The only instructions I was given was  \"to make only two comments\" but unless you write two full paragraphs with separate example and explanations  it will be marked as only having one comment.  And then  you need \"additional comments\" to get full points. IE a third paragraph or the computer will not recognize it. All this while correcting numerous errors.  At times I have to rewrite a whole sentence and at times you may have a spelling error and a verb tense error in the same word.  So if you define it differently than the type the computer will randomly choose you guessed it, you are marked down.  It is just not worth it for $1.35.
