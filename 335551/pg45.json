They care only about the bottom line, whether students are buying more courses, and that's why this class feels more like customer service than teaching. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of service...it feels like teachers, especially in group classes, are more technicians than teachers. The amount of technical issues that aren't pre-screened because they use outdated adobe technology is astounding. I must've spent 10 percent of my time at EF just guiding a student on how to connect their microphone. \r\n\r\nThere are some good people working at EF but the company as a whole is outdated and in need of a serious revamp. If you're living in SE Asia it can be lucrative but the pay rates are a joke anywhere outside of that. They don't value their teachers. Avoid this company.",

They encourage you to travel and have a life outside of work, but they understaff and overwork so that is not possible.\r\nPay is garbage. They pay peanuts, and try to compensate for that by throwing frequent parties with free beer.\r\nThere is a culture of mistreatment; people are disposable. I know more ex-EFers who have a passionate hatred for the company than those who like it.\r\nIt's like an extension of college--lots of drinking, hooking up, and immature behavior. The company as a whole has a bad reputation for outrageous parties (i.e. people throwing up in restaurants, getting into fights).",

They aren't retaining new external talent because their current management is not receptive to any changes. In fact, they don't even care enough to give you an exit interview. Instead, they focus on surface level things to make their entry level workers believe that they are a cool, modern place to work and hope that some of them turn into  lifers who know nothing about how an organization should run, because they have only ever worked at EF.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for a modern company who prides themselves on being global, their resistance to WFH and their terrible maternity leave policies are frankly embarrassing.",
