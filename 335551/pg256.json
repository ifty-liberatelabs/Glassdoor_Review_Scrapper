Also, all staff receive an additional 11 days of leave for Chinese holidays. Regarding the start-up loan, we provide this benefit as we recognize that it can be expensive to move to a new country and want to ensure teachers feel supported financially. The loan is purely optional and the 10 month repayment scheme was specifically designed to minimize the financial impact to teachers of the loan repayment. With regard to your work permit, we operate according to the law \u2013 your work permit is always available for you borrow for purposes where it might be required, however we require that EF retains it for safekeeping as this document is highly burdensome to replace. Finally, the discriminatory practices you raise are a serious concern and we encourage you send an email to compliance.china@ef.com so we can investigate the issue further.",
