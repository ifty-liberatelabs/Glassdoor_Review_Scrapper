However, just because someone was good at their previous role, does not mean they immediately have the tools necessary to manage staff effectively. We have great personalities here- people like their managers, but I think it would be helpful to train management more frequently on things they may not know inherently: how to recognize an employee's potential, how to have difficult conversations, what are different intrinsic motivators to encourage your team, etc. Once middle management is better supported, I think we would feel a huge shift in overall employee stability and happiness.",

Management is not great at dealing with issues brought to them from both students and teachers. Students are often seen waiting for an appointment outside closed office doors, but management has already left. The way problems are dealt with and the way people are spoken to by management is highly unprofessional. The students smoke in front of the school, which makes it look like a party school and forces people to walk through a thick cloud of smoke to enter the school. I would hold my breath every time I walked into the school. Due to the location and image, you get a lot of students who are not serious and prefer to go to the beach or party rather than come to class.
