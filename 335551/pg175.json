Management was extremely unsupportive from the very beginning largely due to a lack of communication and presence, lack of clear expectations of the job and linsufficient training. This lack of support extended to also a lack of care when staff expressed a decline in their well-being due to job-related matters. Finally, there is also a lack of care relating to proper payments for trainings as staff are required to follow up on their payments themselves multiple times to ensure they are properly compensated for their work. The staff feel overall exploited as contracts include potentially illegal articles, such as enforcing staff to opt-out of the labour laws and work 6 days a week, which can be detrimental to mental health and work-life balance. Furthermore, employees are constantly working without the legally issued 11 hour work break between shifts. This issue of management runs from the least to most senior and has created a horrible company culture. I do not recommend for anyone to work here.",

The downtown location in Budapest is unbeatable, and the terrace with its amazing view is a real perk.\nThe company culture is fantastic. There's always something going on, with weekly events that help to foster a sense of community. Plus, the free coffee and fruits are a nice touch.\nBut what sets EF apart is its commitment to employee well-being. Every month, we're treated to new benefits, like free transit, AYCM cards, and SZEPCards. It's clear that the company values its employees and is always looking for ways to make their lives better.\nThe people here are friendly and supportive, making it a great place to work.",
