It is so egregious that one wonders if their orientation, which stressed the importance of this over and over, was meant somehow ironically. \r\n\r\nIn short, I could not image a company so vast, with so much potential and so many resources, more destined to fail than this one!  Based on the seeming indifference to staff from management, the lack of spirit toward motivating staff in the company culture (in practice at least) and clearly substandard wages, it is obvious to me that this is a simply out-dated and unsustainable organization.
