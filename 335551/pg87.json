They will put you through a long drawn out training process to not even teach you how to sell their product. This company focuses on forcing teachers who do not want to travel with students to travel with them, they use very pushy sales tactics on those teachers and call them until they want to answer the phone and cuss you out. The recruiters will tell you how supportive the company is, but if you are not getting them tours, there is no chance you are staying. You get a sales coach who will tell you how to be pushy and then if you are not blame it on your personality. They do not pay that well and the commission structure is not great either, if you want to be in sales you can go somewhere else and make more.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you also how heartless of a company EF is. I started with them virtually and did not even get the chance to be with them for 90 days. They put me through a training that was more about policy then it was how to sell their product. I got set up with 60 crusty leads for several weeks, and then they wondered why I had not made any sales after calling through them for about two weeks. After that they gave me a about a 100 more leads who were so cold, it was deplorable. After working with those for 3 weeks, my manager who had met me twice gave me two weeks over the holidays (the worst time for sales) to turn things around. During that time no one reached out to see if I needed help or how I was doing, on top of giving me very unrealistic expectations. To ice the cake, they led me on for several days before letting me go, my manager pushed the meeting off three times which is unacceptable. They decided to fire me instead of lay me off after their failure not mine. I would not recommend EF to anyone, not a soul. They say how great it is, but if you look at the other reviews, you will see a pattern of rudeness and unprofessionalism. As I said before if you get an offer from this company take this review to heart and run the other way.",

Our Entrepreneurial Sales Development Program is a two year program, however our goals within the first 90 days are for our newly hired Tour Consultants to learn our consultative based sales process, understand and execute basic sales metrics (qualitative and quantitative), and for us to see improvement in sales skills. When it is clear that a team member is not progressing in this sales role, the trainers partner closely with the individual and their manager on a plan for improvement. Our ultimate goal is to help each person find success in their role, both financially and from a career growth perspective. We understand how disappointing it can be for everyone involved when that doesn\u2019t work out. We appreciate your feedback and will take this as a chance to make sure we are constantly improving the onboarding experience. We wish you all the success in your future professional endeavors.",

If you're a skilled worker, I promise your value will be better recognized, utilized, and compensated at any other company. If you're straight out of college or in dire need of work, this place will be tempting. I made this mistake for you, and after about 2.5 years and 3 different roles, I'd advise you to look elsewhere. Current 'diversity' initiatives are extremely lacking and require staff to 'brainstorm' on makeshift 'task forces' without any actual structural or culture changes. I literally had to personally confront a manager (who later, ironically, led one of these task forces) about a profile picture they had in blackface. If you are part of the BIPOC or LGBTQIA+ communities, don't trust this place. They do NOT have your back and you will be asked to 'educate' the majority white, cis, straight staff under the guise of 'professional development.' Take a look at the \r\ncompany responses on other 1-star reviews here - that is the exact tone and attitude you can expect from the recruitment and development team. I wish I had better things to say - I pretended to be happy here for too long. The fact that selling group tours to senior citizens during a global pandemic feels incredibly unethical is never acknowledged. I do hope your experience is better than mine, but this place is in dire need of fundamental structural change.",

We never intend to burden our BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ community members with educating the rest of our population, so I appreciate you sharing that experience. A lot of incredible professional development content has originated from our Employee Resource Groups (EFinity groups) - we're grateful that so many members of the EF community have come forward and volunteered their time in that way. We have also brought in consultants and educators from outside EF to train on topics like Unconscious bias, Understanding Racism, and manager trainings focused on DEIB. As an education company, we know how important professional development will be in our efforts to create a truly diverse and inclusive workplace. As for your comment about the manager's profile picture, I'm very concerned about that - if you're willing, we would appreciate if you would share more details with us at HR@ef.com so we can properly investigate.\n\nThe pandemic has made this past year and a half a challenge for us. All along, we have focused on following CDC recommendations, keeping our customers safe, and providing flexibility that allowed our customers who wanted to plan for future travel to protect their investment in the process. We are grateful to see the light at the end of the tunnel now and look forward to resuming more travel. \n\nOnce again, I thank you for your time and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.",
