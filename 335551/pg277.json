The chinese staff only care about customer service. I mean, customer service is important, but here, they really push us beyond. For example, during summer intensives, they will beg us to work over the 40ACH contract hours. We tell them we are tired~ their response? So what. I mean~ for them to get us to work is great, as we get paid to work, but to abuse us to work beyond our contract hours? I mean... is this a revenge to us for corporate America operating sweat shops in china?\r\n2. They will make us teach from 9am to 9pm. They treat us like robots. Again! Money money money.\r\n3. One time, I actually did work over my contract hour to help them. What's their way of thanking me? To stay longer on a Sunday to do some extra stuff. I mean~ that's already pushing it. at the minimum, can't they order us some dinner? Nope.\r\n4. Visa- after we complete our contract at the westernized sweat shop teaching English, they cancel our visa and make us go home. They won't release your visa so you can transfer to other company. EF is the only company that does not release your visa. I strongly advise you interviewing at other schools and ask them about the visa release policy. I guarantee you that only EF will tell you they cancel the visa. If your recruiter say otherwise, get that in writing!",

The experience varies entirely depending on where you are placed. Give good thought for what you are looking for in an employer.  Depending on who your DOS and colleagues are, it can be a constructive experience or a daily nightmare. INSIST ON GETTING THE CONTACT INFORMATION OF CURRENT TEACHERS IN THE CITY BEFORE ACCEPTING. Be ready to take English teaching as if it were preparation for a space mission.\r\n\r\nADVICE TO MANAGEMENT:\r\nIt really depends on what kind of DOS/senior teacher/training director you are already, but to all,  don't drink an excessive amount of the Kool-Aid. Do well by your teachers acknowledging that EF policy is not absolute truth. Micromanaging or going in too hard on the propaganda can drive good teachers out. Wanting to have a work-life balance or different work environment does not make someone any less of a teacher. Above all, understand that you teach English to children.",

Salary is not impressive. It's basically ESL minimum wage for a crazy work load. It would be rated 1 star if private health insurance wasn't included, but it is, which isn't a given in a language center. (Bonuses are also included, but vary by city.)\r\n\r\nFunctioning is insanely standardized. There is a standard procedure for E V E R Y T H I N G. There is a right and wrong way to do anything. And management will hear if you do anything incorrectly. (Even if you aren't told that they know.) It all feels staged to maintain the EF image.\r\n\r\nThe work load is crazy. On top of a full teaching load, there is daily busywork and mandatory office hours. 16 weeks a year are \"intensive \" periods where the work week is 6 days instead of 5. \r\n\r\nWhile people are \"nice\" and \"polite,\" there is a culture ratting. While positive relationships between colleagues are encouraged, working through conflicts directly and respecting relationship boundaries is not. Management wants to have their hands in everything. (Although the extent of it also varies by management.)\r\n\r\nEF is unabashedly full of itself. Being such an international name, it takes its size/bottom line as a sign of superiority. And any teachers who joins is expected to tow the line as well. \r\n\r\nWhile a greater emphasis is put on education than you may find at a Chinese company, when push comes to shove, it's still money at the core.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to leave after one contract, it will be because you don't take teaching and your own development seriously. You aren't up to the EF standard so you can go and play your game. (Although they are too polite to say that to your face.)\r\n\r\nAND ABOVE ALL: BE AWARE THAT EF DOES NOT (normally) TRANSFER VISAS. So good luck trying to go to another school after finishing your contract.\r\n\r\nStepping back, it's amusing to acknowledge that the functioning of this entire empire is built on . . . .

If you are looking to make a career out of English teaching and are ready to settle down/sell your soul without concerns about income, you'll be a perfect fit. Opportunities for promotion, a career path and \"training and development\" are readily available (and pushed on you).\r\n\r\nThe experience also depends entirely on who your superiors are. I was fortunate have a manager (Director of Studies/DOS) that is pretty much as good as they get within EF. But the DOS can also make your life a living hell if they so desire. It's really the luck of the draw.\r\n\r\nDepending on how seriously you are taking teaching, EF can be a good place to improve as a teacher as a serious emphasis is on \"training and development.\"\r\n\r\nEF is not a Chinese company. There is foreign management and the way that foreigners think/work is largely understood. There is still a concern for the wellbeing/concernperspetives of the teachers. (Although good luck going up against any of the standard procedures.)\r\n\r\nHR (can) be incredibly effective and organized so the visa process glides and business is done a legit way. You don't have to watch your back in ways that you would at a Chinese company. (Although you should still stay alert.) \r\n\r\nEF is a respected company abroad, so having its name on your CV can go a long way.
