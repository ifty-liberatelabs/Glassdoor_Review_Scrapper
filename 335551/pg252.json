For someone who is serious about a career teaching, I'd steer clear. The Chinese start at double and the pay.

There is no incentive to work for a company that is only profit orientated and has a total lack of respect for its staff. I used my time there as a stop gap as i had just returned to the UK and needed a job quickly. However it was most stressful and unpleasant work environment I have ever known. The lack of professionalism and respect the management (and overall the whole company)have for their staff is astounding. Coupled with the unrealistic experience of a personalised and professional service the students expect is a toxic mix of disappointment and chaos. \r\nI now warn any local EAL teacher or potential pupil in Manchester to stay away from that EF. I would also never trust a company who are so greedy that they base their payroll and financial dept. in Holland to avoid paying any REASONABLE  amount of tax, something I also share with your potential clients.
