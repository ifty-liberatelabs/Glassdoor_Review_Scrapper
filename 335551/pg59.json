It always has it always will, because at its heart, the company cares about profit to the hult family, not any care to their employees. They will tell you an earning potential and I can guarantee that less than 10 people in the entire company in the TC role hit that. \n\nIn the Denver office you have to be one in one million to get promoted past the TC role. Most directors inform their employees that they have to work for them for 4-6 years in the TC role at barely minimum wage hitting every goal to be even considered for a promotion. \n\nIf you manage to be one of the million promoted (pre covid) they don\u2019t actually fire anyone so employees get stuck with barely competent managers who don\u2019t even know what the role looks like. TCs are stuck working with employees that managed to have the \u201cmagic spark\u201d but yet can do the basic role. Managers also play hard favorites blatantly. \n\nGoals are set at an arbitrary 10% growth number. Anything less than 10% is unacceptable and you will be forced out. Why 10% you ask? Great question, literally no one knows. The biggest publicly traded companies in the world don\u2019t even have 10% growth. Also there are a limited number of school in your territory and a limited amount of parents and students that can actually afford the tours. \n\nThe product (international tours for students with their teachers) keeps getting more expensive and the quality keeps going down. The company is now desperately seeking solutions for a self made problem where they can\u2019t physically support the number of tours they require TCs to sell because there aren\u2019t enough hotels or restaurants to hold them. The hotels are barely inhabitable, especially in the summer, putting the students in inhospitable conditions but it\u2019s never EFs fault. \n\nManager are given free rein on their teams so bonuses, promotions, how work is done is completely to their discretion. This leads to some teams being mandated to have at least 10 sales calls during a global pandemic where others get to sit home and do nothing all day. Pre-covid, certain teams were held to expectations of hours worked where others were allowed to barely show up. This unequal balance resulted in one team getting $5,000 bonuses that weren\u2019t tied to goals where others weren\u2019t ever allowed to see this money for employees that were equal. \n\nWatching their treatment of employees as they have started to lay-off has been disappointing and sad and yet proves everything about them. Watching their treatment of their clients has shown even more. \n\n\nDo you want to party all over the world? Work for EF\nDo you want to grow in your career and advance and learn?
