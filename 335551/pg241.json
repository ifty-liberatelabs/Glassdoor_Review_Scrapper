There is no organization, my location (wuhan) disregarded the contract, nobody is professional, the management team is constantly absent, and all policies are ignored. Teachers are taken advantage of and are nothing more than an attraction to sell courses (At my location at least). Student welfare is ignored, even if they're in the wrong level. I have several students who can't learn anything because they were placed in wrong levels. The  management team and PAs refuse to tell the parents and move them because they're afraid those parents will be angry. This just leads to a student who can't learn. Their confidence takes a toll too. \r\n\r\nEF makes it sound so good in the interview, and sure, there are a lot of benefits. And you'll never be cheated out of pay. But at the end of the day, when you feel used and sorry for the students not getting a real education, it's not worth it.",
