The majority of teams enjoy each other\u2019s\u2019 company and can be found spending time together outside of office hours. In terms of Benefits, the health/dental plan is extremely affordable and managers encourage employees to use EF\u2019s generous vacation policy to strive for a better work/life balance. Rather than having a set corporate ladder, employment at EF is very fluid. After proving yourself, EF will give you the freedom to explore other business functions to help test where you passions ultimately lie.",
