It's another thing when you are a part of a building of 900+ people who all equally believe in that one mission-making the world a more understanding and inclusive place. With multiple years at this company, in multiple different jobs around sales, I have learned there is so much more to what 'work' means. It shouldn't be a clock in and clock out. It shouldn't be a paycheck to get ahead. It shouldn't be something that doesn't make you feel good at the end of the day. Work should be fulfilling and fun. Work should be something you're proud of. Work should be a place where you feel challenged, supported, inspired and encouraged to be your truest/best self every day. THAT is what working at EF is. It's hard work no matter what you do. But the impact, the outcome, and the EF community are incomparable. Believe what you want to. People write negative reviews when they're angry. Doesn't make them untrue, but there's more to every review.  Think about what's important to you and then take a real look at EF, and find a way in.",
