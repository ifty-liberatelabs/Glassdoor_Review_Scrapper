Your actions have affected people's lives and the teachers at EF Oxford want to work hard and teach students not be used and then thrown away. The management need to take a long look at themselves and think about the damage they have done to good teachers.\r\n\r\n We all worked hard for the year and helped turn the school around and the thanks we got was shameful, competent managers must be appointed.\r\n\r\nDon't just appoint yes men.",
                        "adviceOriginal": null,
                        "cons": "Appalling working conditions\r\n\r\n40hrs a week, often with a double banking 30 hr contact time 'summer' timetable even in winter. Many teachers stay until 7pm even 9pm (unpaid) to plan and many come in on weekends. The management are out the door at 5.30 sharp. There is a mentality of don't bother planning, which affects class quality and teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nUnderstaffed and overworked, leading to teacher breakdowns in the staff room, I've lost count of how many teachers I have seen in tears due to stress and being pushed too hard. It is a very upsetting environment to be part of and at times can become violent, one teacher recently snapped and shouted and swore in the corridor and threw things in the staff room.   \r\n\r\nToxic environment of us vs them mentality with the management. The management are sorely under trained and lack basic man management skills. They allow anonymous, informal complaints with no evidence, to escalate into close door meetings where you are intimidated and questioned on every aspect of what you do. Such accusations can be- 'Negativity', 'undermining teachers abilities' or 'making teachers feel uncomfortable'. All with no evidence and all very stressful. Most of the complaints come from senior teachers who listen in on private conversations and report back to the management or simply make things up. It is impossible to defend yourself when you don't even know/understand what you said or did. This behaviour led to several teachers leaving and is wholly unacceptable, bordering on bullying. \r\n\r\nFurther to this, the inductions are atrocious and almost non existent. The support is apparently available only if you go and ask for it and only when the office door is literally open which it is often not, leaving many teachers to make crucial decisions themselves.  A teacher with little experience who recently started was fired instead of given support as his classes weren't up to standard and absolutely no one helped him. \r\n\r\nChances of promotion appear to be based on how friendly you are with the management. Often candidates with a DELTA or more experience are overlooked for teachers who may have been there longer. A teacher who was on very good terms with the management quickly become a senior teacher (within 6 months), overlooking a candidate who had actually been there longer and got on well with other teachers leading many, whether true or not, to believe that the system is based on cronyism. \r\n \r\nInappropriate messaging between teachers and students. Several teachers were privately messaging students on social media as well as clubbing and drinking with them. Most of them have now left.\r\n\r\nPoor quality classrooms and materials- 17 students in a class, some of the classrooms are tiny with barely enough space for 17 students and a teacher, in the summer the temperatures can reach unbearable and unsafe levels, causing students and teachers to feel sick. Only some have projectors and slow computers, a big disappointment for a 'flagship' school, many broken chairs or chairs with small flip tables despite students preferring rooms with tables. The EF books themselves are of the poorest quality: full of mistakes, awful audio recordings and answers to reading and listening that don't even make sense, they are often ditched for better books. Constantly breaking photocopiers. Students are paying  a lot and receiving very little quality in return.\r\n\r\nAll round unfriendly colleagues, outside of the staff room, with poor, unpaid, interns working ridiculously hard to try and keep students happy.   \r\n\r\nA broken review system where a teacher is expected to get 4.4/5 on their student evaluations or expect to be fired and/or subjected to constant private meetings. The review system only determines whether or not the student likes you which is almost impossible to improve with  many teachers becoming close friends with students or simply playing games with them in order to achieve a high rating. One teacher who received low ratings was hounded out of the school and spent her final week off due to stress and anxiety induced by the job.  \r\n\r\nAny success or target achieved is met with sweets or ice cream as if we are children. This is a huge business with a massive turnover and there is nothing in the budget for bonuses for reaching targets or even to buy books. The salary is also too low, 18k a year is not enough to live in Oxford, one of the most expensive places in England. Many teachers share houses with people and still pay upwards of \u00a3500. \r\n\r\nInsanely high turnover, we lost 4 teachers in a week once, and in my one year there I saw possibly 20+ people come and go.  Many sighting the working conditions and management as reasons for leaving",

Beautiful words mean nothing when they are empty which they were and we all felt it.

Managers during my time at EF have changed half a dozen times; it took long for senior management to hire one level above me and even on my level due to low attraction value of positions and compensation/base salary. \r\nMost staff start out as trainee with 2,000 monthly gross salary which hardly anyone can survive on in Zurich. The reason people accept this low salary is that they are expats and often desperate. \r\nOnce you are inside the organisation which is highly political and - at least the EF Educational Tours department - moving slow in terms of changes, you realise that senior management, i.e. CEO does not value its staff and tries to keep the employees 'engaged' through sparse want-to-be motivational E-Mails, free-booze parties and other cheap and outdated goodies. \r\nDevelopment and staff training is handled on a department basis and often initiated and carried out by employees that are invested. When they realise the work-load for their actual job is immensely high (I did the work that should have been divided amongst 3 employees) they loose motivation and the respect of their managers for not-so-good managers are common at EF depending on the department and product. They sometimes cannot be blamed for not supporting you because of the lack of support they receive from higher above. \r\n\r\nMoney is everything for EF and the Hult family and the longer you work at EF the more you realise that their mission to open the eyes through education and a fair world does not reach and is acted out in the office amongst employees. Base salaries are ridiculously low so that I could have worked at the till at Migros without the stress and exploitation. \r\n\r\nProgressing your career is many times not possible due to managers hiring from outside. Once you have hit the ceiling you either look sideways and for opportunities inside the company or leave. The latter is likely to be the better option.",

On a social level it is like being back in High School where everyone knows your business and there is more participation in back stabbing in order to get a leg up, rather than working for it.  Also, it's not exciting because you are expected to call through your pipeline like a machine and this becomes brainless very fast.  \r\n\r\n-Management  focuses more on numbers than an individuals overall development.  With proper development numbers will follow organically while maintaing a successful and happy work force. \r\n\r\n-Middle Management is sub-par mainly due to the fact that they lack overall experience and ability to assist in professional development. \r\n\r\n-Some Senior Level Managment is underqualified and unprofessional.  Senior Management does not value their employees.  Some of these individuals openly express their feelings of regret for hiring current employees.  Additionally, they talk down in a demeaning manner to new and tenured employees creating an unstable and unhealthy work environment.  At an organizational level, there are many instances where entry level employees to high-ups partake in innapropriate conversations with regards to co-workers and other varying subjects. This may be in part to having a bar located on the first floor of the building.  I guess some people shouldn't consume alcohol if they can't act in an appropriate manner. \r\n\r\n-Very Political.  For the most part, promotion from within is based on who management likes on a personal level and is not based on abilities, growth potential, level of intelligence, and overall tenure and contributions at an organizational level.",
