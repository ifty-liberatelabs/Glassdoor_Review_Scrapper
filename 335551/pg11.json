When I tried to move positions, I was offered almost 10k less than what I was making at one job, and completely ignored and strung along at another one. I am very disappointed in this company that I once wanted to work for so badly. The stress with this job was one of the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced, and half my team left after I did which really says something. Someone on my team was cheating for almost two years, and nothing was done about it. I absolutely loved the trips and the company itself, but working for them was another story. Most people don\u2019t stay at this company for long, and I really wish they prioritized their employees more than just fancy Christmas parties and free food sometimes.",
