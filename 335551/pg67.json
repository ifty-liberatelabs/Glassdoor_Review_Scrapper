There is lots of opportunity to get to know your coworkers, own your own business and grow your territory (sales), and plenty of true connection between colleagues, who come to be friends and truly feel like one big EF family. Upper management truly cares about their employees happiness and feedback, and encourages open conversation about personal and professional development, all while EF as a large company provides PD experiences quite often. The loose schedule and management style fosters self-motivation and time management, allowing us to take control of our success. In addition, the open floor plan creates an amazing buzz on the sales floor, and allows us to feel one with our team and surrounding pods, as well as very supported throughout the day, and our benefits are truly amazing. The casual dress code policy, ping pong & foosball area, as well as having a bar and a cafeteria with amazing employees right downstairs doesn't hurt either!",

The site that I worked at for the summer was not conducive AT ALL to a summer program and all of the activities that were scheduled by upper management made absolutely no sense for the state the site was in. They would have shopping outings in towns with no shopping options or a color run in an area with no place to do so without getting fined.\r\n\r\nStudents' families were also understandably upset and threatened to have their kids sent back home given that they were told their kids would be staying in one state when in reality their host families, classes, etc. were in another state. This put us between a rock and a hard place and (I thank the activity manager and leader so much for this) we had to revamp the entire schedule to fit the student's interests.\r\n\r\nThere was also a HUGE problem with our accommodations manager who cared more about the host families than the international students. They would also micromanage EVERYONE and would have other people do her work (ie. reaching out to families, scheduling pick-ups, etc.) \r\n\r\nUpper management wasn't much help either in training or presence. They would defend their decision in not hiring more staff (we had 1 activity leader for over 40 kids), send us on last-minute trips, and we often had to work late hours to pick up students from airports or stay overnight with them at hotels.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved engaging with the students every day and would have loved to do it again but that was truly the most stressful job I ever had.",
