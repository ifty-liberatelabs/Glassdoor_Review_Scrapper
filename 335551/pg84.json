For example, when a black employee brought this problem to the CEO, the CEO responded with \"but we have many international offices in places like China and Europe\".\r\n\r\nAlthough I did learn a lot during my time at EF, it became evident at the very beginning of my time at EF that the company does not invest very much in their employees. Although there is a rotational aspect to the program, there is very little direction once you arrive on the team. There was also minimal communication from my manager and the team I was entering, which made my entrance into the teams quite abrupt. They advertise the \"independent\" aspect of the program as a pro, but they forgot to consider that you need SOME direction and guidance when it comes to projects. They seem to expect that one person can be a programmer, pm, designer, scrum master at once without any help.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the reason why this program felt like an over-glorified internship was because I seemed to always be given miscellaneous projects that died the moment I left a team to start the next project. The teams themselves were always too busy with their own responsibilities to maintain the projects. I joined the program mainly because of the supposedly high impact.",

In my time here, I heard multiple stories of employees' motivations being questioned when they asked for a raise. In successful years, the raises at annual reviews were the same percentage increase no matter how successful the company was that year, but as soon as a bad year came along the raises were eliminated. TLDR, unless you have a partner in a lucrative career or you are moving from a lucrative career, it is impossible to build financial security while being an employee at EF. They will probably comment on this post about how they are constantly looking at the market rate for salaries and are confident in their offer, but I know from all the phone screens I did with hiring managers for similar roles as the one I had at EF that this isn't even close to true.\r\n\r\nCompanies are free to operate under any business model they wish. But the terrible salaries here mean that talented people leave all. the. time. and as a result, the people who are left behind are stuck holding the bag and burning themselves out while trying to cover for the people who are constantly leaving.",

I did the math and made $12/hour with my salary before tax).\r\n\r\nAfter 3 months, our manager fired all 4 of us with no real explanation other than \"it's not going to work\".  Keep in mind that about 2-2.5 months in she hired another 3-5 people for the team.  Seems to me like she was trying to scare the new hires to get them to work extra hard.  I looked them up on LinkedIn and none of them were there after 6 months.\r\n\r\nThe pay was an absolute joke for the amount of time and effort put in.  Like I said above, $12/hour is completely unreasonable for the type of role this was.  Also, commissions were very small - don't expect much from that, especially since there isn't much you can do in a few months before they let you go.\r\n\r\nMost of the good reviews on here exist because the management pressured people to do so - don't buy into it, especially if you are straight out of college.  Employers don't like to see that you worked at a place for just 3 months and it's not a good way to start, or advance your career.\r\n\r\nAfter the whole \"honeymoon, welcome to the team\" phase, you will be relentlessly hounded to increase numbers and work 10-12 hour days, especially when you see the turnover and how people are fired.",
