If you were to fall ill, your coworkers will need to take your classes even if they are busy themselves, therefore you are discouraged to take any sick days and if you do everyone will be extremely overworked thus creating hate and tension amongst coworkers. The managers also call to pressure, guilt, or yell at you, whatever is needed to get you into work. They really don't care about your well-being. \r\nThe work environment is quite toxic with the manager creating feuds between coworkers with the whole \"he said she said\" and gossip whether it is true or not and always acting innocent and saying they are totally on your side or how they understand you. They say things I guess sometimes for kicks, and other times to get things to work their way. Having a sick person's workload being put onto other very busy coworkers creates hatred.\r\nOverworked in the summer times as they want to have regular classes plus special summer classes, so on top of the regular class you teach 2-4 more classes a day depending on your schedule. Everyone is extremely stressed and wiped out during this period.",

For incoming teachers, all costs related to your visa will be reimbursed  upon arriving in China once your bank account is set up. In regards to transferring money, we have no control over regulating laws so encourage staff to research requirements in China and the country where the money is being sent to. We understand that the first day of onboarding can be long after travelling overseas, but due to the visa process a lot does need to happen on that first day in order to meet visa deadlines. However, we will take this into consideration. We know that understanding cultural differences doesn't happen over night so hope that after 1+ years with us you got to a point where you felt comfortable. We will also share this feedback and see how we can best support the staff making the transition. If you would like to share any additional feedback feel free to email us at teacher.welfare@ef.cn. Best of luck with your future endeavors.",
