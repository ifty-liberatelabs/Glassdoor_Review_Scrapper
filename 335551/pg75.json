Talent has been lost due to lack of guidance and support.  I think this is improving with the new training programs that just launched and it is going in the right direction but this is definitely something that can be improved.  Con #2 - Work Life Balance - This can be seasonal but EF is definitely a place where work can take over your life.  There are strict sales deadlines, end of fiscal year and a team pressure to be present.  Even though it can be fun, it can be long hours, weeks, seasons.  Con #3 -Salary - for the amount of work and the expectations that EF has; the salary could be better.  I have to say that EF provides great value to their employees which is beyond salary that can make up for it.",

The company culture is one where colleagues view each other as friends regardless of job title and seniority. You can walk into any senior managers office to ask a question or just chat about something you may have in common.  It's refreshing and endearing.  Pro #2 - The company culture - EF is always coming up with a new fun way to keep employees engaged and feeling refreshed.  There is something for everyone and when times are stressful and busy, its nice to have some reprieve and not take yourself too seriously.  Pro #3 - EF Benefits - there are so many perks to working at EF not only is the health plan and 401k impressive but some of the convenience perks (hair salon, manicurist, dry cleaning, restaurant in building, to name a few).  An unwritten benefit is the flexibility and understanding that management has for people to take care of personal matters in their lives.  Employess are treated like people, not a number or someone to just do their bidding.  Pro #4 - Responsibility - It may not sound like it but EF is a lot of hard work.  There are long hours, working weekends, business travel (sometimes the travel is incredible - sometimes it entails a road trip around Detroit or long flights in the middle seat next to the bathroom).  Regardless, EF is a place where you hit the  ground running and then you either sink or swim.  It's certainly not for everyone but it is definitely a place where you are forced to learn autonomously and be resourceful.  EF people truly know how to make things happen and believe nothing is impossible.  There are so many instances where I have found that I am capable of a lot more than I thought and it was due to the trust that EF gives their staff.  Pro #5- Travel and interacting with people all over the world.  Need I say more.",
