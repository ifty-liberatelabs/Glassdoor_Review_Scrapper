Invest in more employees with outside experience that can lend fresh perspectives.

What they fail to realize is that having a casual dress code and the occasional seasonal party are now the bare minimum in employment perks for most web companies. There are very few perks beyond that - essentially only the drinking water is free...not even the employee cafeteria is subsidized in any way. All other typical benefits (medical, 401k match, PTO) are no better than what's average in Boston. In fact, this is the most I've ever paid for basic health insurance in Boston. \r\n\r\nSalaries are shameful - especially for those starting with the company in entry level positions. Even if you climb the ladder, it is unlikely you'll ever make above $50k without being a senior level employee - I promise you, it's that bad. If you join the company in a skilled role with outside experience under your belt, you may have a better shot at making a living wage. That being said, a majority of the employees are either 22-year-olds or people who started with the company at 22 and have no outside experience. This means that there's very little creativity or innovation within many departments. Let's just say, if you plan to join this company with any prior experience, be prepared for a culture shock when you realize how out of touch everyone is and how archaic the processes are. \r\n\r\nBasically, this is a self-praising company that will gloat about how they're blessing you with such a fun, special culture and expect you to be grateful for peanuts.
