I was literally thrown out on the street within a week and not entitled to any unemployment benefits. EF couldn't care less and didn't offer any help for the next steps I had to take. I completely understand the company had to make some hard decisions because of the COVID situation, but the way they did it was absolutely unacceptable and disrespectful to their employees. Being fired in a 10 minute phone call without any compassion is not in line with their so-called attention for employee happiness.\r\nApart from that, managers have no clue of how to train new employees and feeling completely lost the first months apparently is a rule rather than an exception. The salary is ridiculously low compared to similar jobs in Switzerland. Supermarket employees even earn more money than many EF employees. So, to be honest I have nothing good to say about this company. I expected a lot, because the hiring procedure was very pleasant and made me enthusiast about the new challenge. This made my disappointment even bigger after getting to know the \"real\" company.",
