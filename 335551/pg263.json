Entry level staff is very female dominant, so it is obvious when upper management only address the few men on the team. Women often feel disregarded and were recently vocal about this in a company survey, however, it is important to note this response was shot down quickly by a male higher-up in a room full of women. The survey was never discussed with a third party or anyone in HR, so there was no safe environment to discuss the responses; this made it clear to all employees that management does not care about their staff's opinions. \r\n\r\nHigh turnover and ZERO job security - they are quick to fire. Management leads by intimidation (via gossip and/or lack of communication in genera and by firing your peers) not by example. Upper/middle management is not respected as a result so there is no \"role model\" and employees don't strive to improve.",
