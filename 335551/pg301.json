We consistently evaluate and upgrade our programs and offer ongoing training to teachers to ensure students receive a high-quality experience. We also care a lot about our teachers and implement systems that aim to develop and foster career growth. We are always interested in hearing suggestions on how we can improve the teacher experience.
