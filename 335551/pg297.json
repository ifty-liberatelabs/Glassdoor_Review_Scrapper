They don't bother to read your messages and will send you the same useless reply every time. \r\n\r\nTotal blame culture against teachers. Numerous technology issues with their platform- always the teachers fault. Their codes for technical problems say it all really. You have SSP for student side problem, TTP for teacher technical problem and TSP which is also a teacher side problem- who knows what the difference is but both dock your pay and both fail to acknowledge any failure with the company technology. Added to that there is ZERO technical support. \r\n\r\nYou also need to fill out a tech report if you can't enter class (it happens often) and despite that you still get an accusatory email that says you failed to attend class and you then need to follow up with further defense to prove that you weren't tardy. \r\n\r\nThe teachers are made to jump through hoops to fill out an invoice only to be met with discrepancies anyway. You then waste an hour of your time each month re-checking your invoice, because it is so complicated. So why waste our time- just pay us. \r\n\r\nThe hours are also incredibly unreliable. You can request 20 hours across the week, and get a random allocation (students don't choose you, the company allocates you randomized slots)  of 6 hours across six different days with 1-2 hours between classes, for example. Often a complete waste of  a day/ evening for what might be $5/$10. \r\n\r\nIf students don't come to class you don't get paid. You have the option of completing writing corrections but they are tedious and take much longer than the 40 minute class would have. \r\n\r\nI would avoid them like the plague if you have other options. Lowest paid in the industry too, and you get an insulting $1 pay rise after a year in service. This company will kill your soul.",

                        "cons": "The only experience I have is of working in Shenzhen for several months, EF may be great in other cities (I doubt it though!!).\n\nThe pay is terrible compared to many other teaching jobs in China. Training is also poor, often delivered in your own school by unqualified \u2018teachers\u2019 barely able to string a sentence together. \n\nMost of the Senior Teachers, DoS\u2019s and Production Managers appear to have been promoted on the basis they have stuck around as opposed to actually being qualified to do the job. As a result, when you have training for the region, it will inevitably be a complete waste of time and you will come away with no more knowledge than when you went in!!!\n\nA very important point is that foreign teachers already in Shenzhen never join EF, EF relies on glossy brochures to attract new people typically from the USA. Foreign teachers already in Shenzhen (and probably the rest of China) already know what EF is like and avoid it like the plague. They\u2019d rather get paid more and work less hours at proper schools.\n\nLong working hours from Friday to Sunday also become tiresome. Your last class will finish at 9:10pm on Friday and your first class will begin on Saturday at 9:00am. A very quick turn around time. During the week working hours are ok, you will have two days off mid-week such as Monday and Tuesday.\n\nYou will get LESS HOLIDAYS than everybody else, if a public holiday lasts 7 days, you will get 5 days off!! It is extremely frustrating and shows a complete contempt for and lack of respect for staff. Also, during the holidays you will be given forced \u2018admin\u2019 days, the school is effectively closed but you have to go to work and do nothing all day. It feels that EF likes to have a high degree of control over its staff just for the sake of it.\n\nExceptionally high staff turnover due to the above mentioned. At my school, staff rarely renew their contracts, it is impossible to when you consider the low pay, long office hours and terrible \u2018leadership\u2019.\n\nAt the end of the day EF is a business, as long as your students are happy and having fun and as long as their parents continue to pay, nobody cares what you do in the classroom. I\u2019ve seen \u2018teachers\u2019 unable to teach, with terrible grammar, but they are good entertainers, like a clown!! If you are a good entertainer, then perhaps you will do well here.\n\nIf you have worked as a proper teacher back home, or in a decent, corporate job, you will struggle at EF. It is better suited to young graduates with little or no working experience.\n\nThere are no opportunities to travel as you work so much and have very few holidays. If you want to be able to travel and experience China you need to work at a public school as the holidays there are long. If you work at a training center like EF, your busiest times are when public schools have holidays.\n\nDuring the busier times your schedule will be a nightmare. My schedule this summer was working from 8:30am- 12-30pm and then 5:00pm - 8pm or 9pm. In between the class times you may have more pointless admin where you have to sit in the office with no work to do twiddling your thumbs. \n\nSeriously, any positive reviews for EF China cannot be genuine. I have not spoken to any local staff or foreign teachers that have actually enjoyed working at EF.",

                        "cons": "I'm going to start with the reason why I quit first. I had a 2 severely autistic children in one of my classes. I'm not a special education teacher. They should not be in my class, they are not befitting from it, and its a major distraction from the rest of the class because either I or the TA have to continuously manage them. One child couldn't even speak and would continuously shout in class and try to run out of the room. One day we didn't even have TA's, and I literally couldn't teach my class because I had to spend the entire class time trying stop this kid from running out, and I got 9 other kids I need to manage. I've been trying to communicate with staff for months about this problem and they either don't understand what autism is or they're too reluctant to give refunds to parents because it looks bad for sales. Here sales are everything.\r\n\r\nCommunication is horrible. I'll be expected to do demo's but the demo materials on the IWB won't work, of course no one will tell me this before I enter the room so I have to improvise the entire lesson on the spot. Or maybe there will be no class scheduled on Omni, and your PA will approach you and tell you that you actually do have class now and you have to rush to your classroom and make something up on the spot or your class and coteachers class will magically swap on omni and the PA will not tell you whats happening. Or guess what? You now have a Life Club that just magically appeared on  your schedule. Dosen't matter if you never did one before, have no idea what it is, and when you ask they just tell you to ask the TA's and then realize I have to come up with a bunch of games, dances lead some trick or treat through the school and a craft. It went pretty badly and it made me late for my next class because of how close it was scheduled to it. Maybe, I don't know, ask if I can actually do it first?\r\n\r\n Demos are essentially extra classes we teach to prospective students. A lot of teachers disliked doing them on grounds that they are teachers and are not interested in sales, but I didn't mind doing demo classes.  Over and over again, however, I had demo's with only one student. When its like that if feels like a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've never worked at a place with such low morale and turnover before. When I first arrived there was 4 foreign teachers quitting at once. None of them had much good to say about the company and one of them, a senior teacher, was tasked with training me. After that nearly every other foreign teacher quit over the next few months, making me, after one other guy the oldest foreign teacher there. The other new hire that came to the school with me also quit before her probation ended because she was so overwhelmed with summer classes.\r\n\r\nInstead of getting properly trained, eg. co-teaching, sitting in on classes I will be taking over I had a full load of summer courses instead and felt like I had no idea what I was doing. Then when they ended, and all the teacher I mentioned before quit, I got all their normal classes in addition to the PTC's, assessments, achievement ceremonies I had no idea how to do, I just had to figure it out.\r\n\r\nPay is very low, career advancement is painfully slow, you will get better work offers in China, and with staff that listen but don't do much its hard to want to stay with EF.",
