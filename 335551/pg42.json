Nevertheless, the school needs to make a good showing on the IB exams. The result: teaching to the test, banning students from the IB diploma (a good thing, actually). The former makes the whole enterprise a big theatre of the absurd, where the actors go through motions, bereft of any significance. \r\nIn addition, being a teacher and a house parent really is a soul drenching drudgery. I have no life at all. I leave the retched hill top once a fortnight. There are piles of useless paperwork, reports, PD (which the admin., smilingly, schedules during the holidays.

I have been here for ten months, my CEM spent two hours training me and then a couple months later we chatted for ten minutes when he decided to chat with the team on an individual basis, and that has been it. In all the time I have been here, my line manager has given me zero feedback.  Nothing bad, nothing good - nothing.  Not once in the ten months I have worked for him has he asked me how things were going in terms of my teaching.  I don't know, maybe non-communication is the latest management trend.   I know I have done a good job, because lots of students have praised me for my work, and I have gotten lots of positive feedback from my Corporate Solutions clients. Two of which have told me that I was the best instructor they have ever had.

There are frequently mornings when I walk into the building, cranky from my commute, and the positive energy from the EF staff always lifts me out of it.\r\n\r\nI have worked at a couple of companies who claim to have a great culture simply because they have a lot of young people on staff. At EF, there are a lot of young people - and of course they are fun and vibrant - but that positive, collegiality runs all the way through the senior team.\r\n\r\nI also love that EF empowers everyone from junior level staff through executives to \"own\" their piece of the business. It frequently feels like I run a startup within the larger company.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, we are a for-profit company that creates life-changing experiences through travel, cultural exchange, language and academics.

So essentially, you're paying for it for the trip. The job its self is extremely repetitive, I felt like I lost brain cells between the cold calling and being surrounded by people okay with making $32,000 a year. Its so depressing. The turn over is CRAZY. Its a revolving door of employees which should be a huge red flag for anyone. After 2 years I really cant think of many great things to say about EF of Go Ahead Tours. Their business model is to find cheap labor, burn them out and move on to the next one. I really am not sure how they get away with paying their employees so little. Really wish I would have left this company as soon as I walked in and didn't buy into all their bogus promises.",
