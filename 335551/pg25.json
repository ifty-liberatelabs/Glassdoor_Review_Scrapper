That perspective immediately made me feel like EF was a special place. One of the nice things about EF (aside from the travel opportunities) is there are 18 different divisions and it's really common to get cross-promoted between them. This makes it less of a standard ladder promotion chart, and instead a spiral staircase making it easier to grow in the organization. \nI've worked the last 5 years if EF Go Ahead Tours, and Ultimate Break, and also think the leadership, particularly the President is incredible. Heidi is positive, while not being unrealistic, and gives 100% into making Go Ahead a great product to travel with and a great place to work.",

The favoritism within EF is obvious and rampant \n\nLow pay - The pay rates at EF are absolutely outrageous, this has gotten worse with covid.\n\nWork life balance is non existent, you are expected to be on call 24/7 which in light of the pay is especially unacceptable. EF also will pay employees just above a certain rate so they can avoid paying overtime. \n\nManagement / senior staff view the students as \"customers\" its all about the money, money, money. Sending 16 year olds who have contracted covid (because the school is overbooked) to hotels and expecting them to pay thousands on their own and being told don't worry they'll be paid back eventually by insurance is heartless. \n\nI could go on but the general point is avoid EF if you value having a life, making a decent wage and going into work expecting respect.",
