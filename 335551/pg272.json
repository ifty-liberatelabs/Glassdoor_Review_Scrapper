As a member of the marketing team I had a fairly good work/life balance, unless I was working on a big project, but even then I usually stayed late just to make sure the work was above average. When I was there, there were a lot of legacy managers and directors in charge of products and divisions that had no business leading a team. They were not qualified, were often absent, and were not making decisions that were in the best interest of growing a product or brand.  However, that may have changed in the years since I was there, and I will also add that I also saw the company hire some incredibly talented, brilliant individuals during my time there. There was also a bit of a lack of upward mobility, in the sense that most opportunities I saw were lateral rather than vertical.",
