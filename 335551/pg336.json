We do have a supplementary Managing Difficult Situations document that may help you beyond your training, so please do ask management if you haven\u2019t received that. Due to the nature of the services that we provide, we do need to understand that students and their parents do require some flexibility with their booking, so we are unable to enforce a mandatory attendance policy. With that said, we will take this feedback onboard, and look for opportunities to improve. And finally, the lack of hours is caused by the lower student demand at the moment. With more schools opening in China, we\u2019re hopeful that the student demand will increase in the coming weeks.\n\nThanks again for your sharing your experience.",
