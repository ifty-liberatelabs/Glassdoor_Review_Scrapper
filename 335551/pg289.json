If you treat your teachers with such a lack of respect, you will end up with the bottom of the barrel, and it doesn't matter the scare tactics you use to try to \"keep them in check\", eventually you won't be the \"#1 online English school\"  (if that is even true).",

But, as time went on, they became more and more difficult to work for.  Here are the Cons:\r\nNo raises, will be fined for missing a class, canceling classes, being late for as little as one minute, not having your report completed on time etc.  Sometimes they not only take your pay away, they go so far as making you pay them for something you did wrong, depending on what you are \"fined\" for.  Their rules are ever changing and very extensive.  It is very difficult to keep up with them all.\r\nYour pay will range from $6-10 for each lesson, depending on where in the world you live.\r\nEach student receives an incredibly extensive report at the end of each lesson from the teacher, with ten boxes each requiring very detailed, very specific information.  Though you are expected to fill them out immediately after each lesson, the time in between classes is not sufficient to complete them. That means you need to do them on your own time.  If not completed in 24 hours, you do not get paid for the class.  \r\nThe \"teacher support\"/\"technical support\" is pretty well non-existent.  They are not to be \"disturbed\" unless for a short list of very specific reasons.  This is very frustrating if you or the student are having technical problems.  If you ask for help on Skype, you are likely to receive an unfriendly message telling you to \"refer to the relevant documents\", which usually doesn't contain information useful for the current situation.\r\nBe ready for emails with threatening tones in regards to new regulations and existing ones.\r\nYou will be treated like a \"number\", not an individual.\r\nTheir concern is not for the student, but more about what benefits them.  For example, the Adobe platform used for the classroom is not very good quality.  Students prefer to use Skype, but Englishtown cannot \"regulate\" your class on Skype.  There are very few circumstances where we are allowed to use it.  We are not allowed to suggest Skype, even if they cannot get their microphone to function in the Adobe classroom.  In this case the student needs to forfeit that lesson.  If the student happens to request Skype, we can only use it as a last resort if they are having severe technical problems.  Students get angry, but teachers will get a \"strike\" against them if it is found out that Skype is used without proper procedure followed and no documentation to show for it (ie. screenshot of written request from the student).  Also, pay will be retracted.\r\nStudents can go so far as cursing at you, and get away with it.  No backing from the company.\r\nRigid rules and regulations do not allow for teachers to use their personal style of teaching that they may excel in.\r\nNo career advancement.  No benefits.\r\nEventually you will dread looking through your email account, just waiting for more rules, scolding, or threats.\r\nYou are expected to update yourself on all regulations and new information listed on a separate site with hundreds of documents.  You are also required to go through hours of training - unpaid.\r\nBottom line - the company does not care about the students, definitely not the teachers and it all boils down to profit. \r\nI'm currently employed with the company but I'm in the process of being hired by another online company that pays much better and is much more relaxed and reasonable.  Once the process is complete, I'll never want to teach with Englishtown again.\r\nWorst.Company.Ever.",
