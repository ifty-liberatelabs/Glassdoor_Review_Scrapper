This makes is extremely difficult to build a rapport with the kids and if you only see a group of children once every two weeks, it's very difficult to have any meaningful continuity in your lessons. The parents have too much power over the employees and the way the business is run. There are also weekly staff meetings - 2 hours long. The pay is average, could be worse but it could be a lot better. Be under no illusions, this is a business, and business comes before delivering a quality education here. I would give the work-life balance a 0 here. Foreign staff retention is very, very low. Nobody stays more than a year and some cut contract earlier. This speaks for itself.",

This quickly expanding program, covers everything from comprehensive health insurance to daily exercise classes, and even talks on nutrition. In terms of promotions, two years ago, we introduced the Academic Career Plan across all schools. This plan was specifically designed to provide career opportunities, and ensure fairness, and transparency when it comes to promotions. Since its release, we have seen teachers staying longer, with many earning advanced qualifications, and moving into more senior roles. As a long-term member of staff, we would love to hear more about your EF experience over the past 4 years. Please feel free to reach out to us at teacher.feedback@ef.com.",
