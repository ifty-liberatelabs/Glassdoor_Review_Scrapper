EF makes you feel like you can be immediately replaced and will not invest in the longevity of their employees. There was an actual \"pay cap\" for the position I was in that was ridiculously insulting. \n- \"the perks\" - EF will brainwash you with trips, parties and other BS to make you forget how little they are paying you. Remember - your rent/mortgage/education and overall basic human necessities cannot be paid in \"wow\" moments. Also, you have a measly 50 euro a day to spend on these trips which buys you a coffee and croissant in Denmark, so enjoy!\n- Management - Management will provide you \"feedback\" without taking their own advice.\n- They set their employees up for failure. During Covid, all that mattered were sales, which is understanding given that they do not want to go out of business. However, this leaves service to clean up the mess with endless nights of travelers coming down with Covid on tour, quarantining in another country for 2 weeks and also holding people to cancellation fees while we are going through a global pandemic.\n-Experts at \"pushing people out\" - If you are even slightly interested in another career path, hold off on mentioning it to management, because your position will be filled within 2 weeks whether you have a new job or not.",
