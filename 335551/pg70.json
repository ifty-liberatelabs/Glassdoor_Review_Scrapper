Otherwise, dumb mistakes get (re)made.  Learn to do the basics when hiring: check ratemyteachers.com, ratemyprofessors.com.  Have several members of a department interview a candidate at once, like nearly every other school does.

                        "cons": "On three occassions, female employees having a second child were either fired or given a reduction in pay upon returning from maternity leave.  \r\n\r\nOne teacher was offered a job at another school outside the US.  EF nixed it.  Someone petty, considering the teacher would be staying only one year longer, due to visa restrictions, and needed to find a new job anyway.\r\n\r\nTwo years in a row our instruction time was reduced, by one month per two-year IB course each time.\r\n\r\nObservations are almost non-existent, as are contracts.  Teacher assessments are based on little to no evidence, and yet this used to be a data-driven campus.  Teachers are let go without explanation, warning, or supportive documentation\u2014nor probation or consultation with the department chair in advance.  Student surveys are also scarce.  Perhaps to reduce contradicting evidence when a teacher is fired?\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t say as much as I\u2019d like to or this review won\u2019t get posted, but there\u2019s been a huge turnover lately in admins, and the new hires knew each other prior.  For the most part, the replacements were downgrades.\r\n\r\nStudent petitions and sit-ins are ignored.  Girls don\u2019t feel safe.  Parents don\u2019t feel their children are safe.  (After one contentious teleconference, one country\u2019s parents pulled their kids out of quarantine and flew them back home.  One teacher was fired--without warning--for not doing hands-on activities in the middle of the pandemic.)  A major policy was imposed mid-year (a common practice here) that moves toward a high-stakes testing environment, with the cover story that it would reduce student stress!  (Meanwhile, colleges are moving more in the direction of emphasizing formative work\u2014the exact opposite pedagogical direction of EF.)  If you like throwing out what works in your classroom and implementing policy that doesn\u2019t, this is the place for you.  Whether your current approach is effective is of no interest.  If just a couple teachers are doing something wrong, then all the teachers get punished with a new rule.  Language from the administration like \u201closer\u201d and \u201cangry Black woman\u201d doesn\u2019t help the workplace environment, either.  And if you\u2019re interviewing to head up Advisory, don\u2019t bother: it\u2019s a third-rail job.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s tough to implement rules, because it\u2019s unclear to what extent the administration is going to back you up\u2014in enforcing their own rules.  Follow through with enforcement on their part is either lacking or not transparent.  (The administration has become increasingly secretive in general.)  The students often exploit this.  \r\n\r\nThe president of EF Academies over in Zurich overrules our school\u2019s committee search for headmaster.  Too far away to understand what a school needs but enough power to do harm.  The wages of a for-profit school\u2026  Speaking of, the wages here are suppressed.  (We\u2019re paid half of what surrounding public schools pay.)  \r\n\r\nThe president\u2019s superior, a C-level man who I won\u2019t identify, says to \"hire a man who would be a best friend and a woman who you'd want to marry.\u201d  The president says they want to employ \u201cteachers who are happy,\u201d full stop.  These two na\u00efve attitudes go a long way to explain why we are where we are.  Where are we?  We don\u2019t even have a functioning tardiness policy.  We used to have a detention system during study hall until students expressed a preference for detention over studying in their cramped rooms.  At this place you could smoke pot and still get promoted, if you come across as happy.\r\n\r\nWith the two English campuses closing and the Sacramento campus ready to cannibalize the COVID-weakened New York campus in \u201922 (enrollment is down 40% two years in a row), I wish EF were public so I could short it.",
