Higher management has no leadership or management skills. For some reason, there's a divide between the teachers and the general staff and that can be very awkward. Pay is extremely low. You are basically on minimum wage, which is only made worse by the fact that you are expected to stay back for hours after work. On top of that, every five weeks you are expected to take an emergency phone for a week. This phone rings NON STOP in the summer, and is still very annoying in winter. You are basically working 24/7 when you have this phone. Higher management also avoids taking the phone, trying to pawn it off on junior staff members. Also the emergency phone is never mentioned at the hiring process. Just a very unpleasant place to work for. Don't be fooled by their good marketing. They don't hire young people to advance and utilize their skills. They hire young people to drain them off energy.",

Foreign teachers are also given a 10,000RMB loan when we arrive so that we can pay for a deposit for a flat etc. Flights and visa costs are also covered by EF, which is great.\r\n\r\n2. New teachers are given a good amount of training, and also time to observe lessons and co-teach after arriving in Chongqing. \r\n\r\n3. There are good teaching resources at the school, and there is a fairly detailed lesson plan for each lesson that we teach. Most teachers don't follow these lesson plans too closely, but they are very useful (especially for new teachers).\r\n\r\n4. Everybody I came across at EF was very nice and willing to help new staff.",
