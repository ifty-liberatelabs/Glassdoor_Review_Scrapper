The free travel is wonderful, but if you have a family or are serious about career growth, that becomes less of a sticking-point.  There is extremely little room to grow, get promoted, and make more money.  I worked at EF for almost 4 years, consistently hit sales goals, brought in over $1 million revenue y/y, and never made more than $60k/yr.  Do not take this job if you're used to working commission-based sales, or at least be very aware of what your salary will be.  Whatever they tell you you can expect in bonus, half it and that's more likely.  Goals will never be less than 10% up y/y, even if you have a giant book of business.   That means, the longer you stay and the better you do, the harder it is for you to make money.  \r\nThey also never let managers, or EF-lifer's,  go (barring economic distress like covid).  Managers are often shuffled around from office to office, department to department, even though they really don't contribute any longer, or are down-right terrible at their jobs and impact the company morale.  If you can survive 7-10 years you're practically untouchable.  \r\nIf you're considering EF, and you're used to a typical Sales salary - look the other way.  Or at the very least be prepared to take a large pay-cut.  If you're recently out of college, looking to learn a lot, have a ton of fun, meet lots of interesting people, and make just enough to be $100 away from living paycheck to paycheck, this is the place for you!",

To clarify a few points: The Tour Consultant position is a sales role where your bonus is dependent on your sales growth and the growth potential of your market. A successful sales person who is able to maximize their market potential is capable of significant earnings year after year. In addition, the EF Denver office is primarily a sales and customer support office. For individuals with proven success who are looking for growth outside of sales and customer support, there are many opportunities throughout the EF worldwide network. We have recently seen Tour Consultants take on new roles in Boston, Zurich, Shanghai and Sydney. If you are committed to staying in Denver, sales is the most common career path. We agree that the EF culture is a strong plus \u2013 the people, the travel and the ability to learn in a sales organization are just a few of the reasons we hear of why people choose a lasting career with EF. We are sorry that EF was not a long-term professional fit for you and wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.",
