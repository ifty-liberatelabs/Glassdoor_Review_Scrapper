Team building activities were separated, celebrations were often separated, miscommunication was a common problem due to lack of mixing. It's entirely possible to work at a centre and not interact with about 1/3 of the staff there (there are three teams usually; Sales, Service, and Education). A shame by design, as EF's intended context from onboarding is that all staff are meant to pursue positive collaboration across all teams to function optimally. \r\n\r\n- EF marketing needs to be more ethnically diverse in 2020. The company in China gives the impression that they only employ ethnically white members of staff, which causes undue confusion to customers, clients, and even staff themselves when they see an employee of a different ethnic group - particularly of a darker complexion (on a bad day it also attracts derogatory comments towards the teachers). This is especially important as EF China in the past couple of years have started to recruit teachers from South Africa, where people of a darker complexion are certainly more prevalent, and should be respected.",

However, at my former company staff were always making fun of how crazy and disorganised it was, so it was kind of an ongoing joke (at some point I believe one has to laugh when things go wrong sometimes). At EF things are very cult-like: they keep telling us ' it doesn't matter if everything is ridiculously disorganised, just don't talk about it'. Returning staff have this really weird loyalty to EF. They don't seem to care that simple things which shouldn't be going wrong ARE going wrong. They keep saying ' oh it's just EF'. So you can't say anything bad about EF because they are so sensitive about it.\r\n\r\nAt my other company, I always got food included in my accommodation fee, we never had to sleep in bunkbed rooms(we always had individual rooms), senior staff did not pay for accommodation because they had the responsability of being on 'emergency call'. At EF you have lots of residential responsabilities, but they would not offer you free accommodation or a discounted price at least. Again, at my other company, some Activity Leaders would become 'guardians' (responsible for students who came to the school without a group and unaccompanied by an adult). In this case, it was considered that the guardian MUST live in the accommodation because they have this extra responsability and therefore, they would be exempt of the accommodation fee.\r\n\r\n At EF it's all about appearances. They would be complaining about the bratty studets behind closed doores but then would go out of their way to buy students pizzas, cakes and McDonalds so that they would get good reviews. We literally had a 1 hour meeting just to talk about how incredibly important it is to get the highest score of student satisfaction. Thye do not really care if the students are having a good time. As long as they are having a good time 'on paper' then it's fine with EF which I find very phony and disingenuous. They know what the problems are but they are just delusional.",

The best part is that the school is directly opposite a stunning mountain and park!\r\n\r\nThe HR department (bless them) take care of you so much. They help you with your apartment, your banking, your phone, taxis, finding your way around the city... They saved me so many times and I couldn't thank them enough!\r\n\r\nYou get the consistent training, the ongoing feedback, and the professional support to strengthen your skills as a teacher and even build your career. That's how I ended up working in the Shanghai Headquarters.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the school really makes sure that it's more than a job. It turns into such an enjoyable experience because you're around people who you build a connection with and who actually care. The atmosphere is just like being with a bunch of friends. It turns into a joy and I've certainly missed the place and the people since I left.",
