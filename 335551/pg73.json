Emphasize the grind and go go mentality and less about the travel dream mentality.  Be open with your team about earnings. Explain why some people may earn more than others and give people the understanding of what they need to get there.  Be empathetic to your team, the roles are exhausting and management often spins it around on the employee making them feel like they aren't doing enough rather than acknowledging the negative or struggles. These teams can often be in high levels of distress. Know this and acknowledge it.",

The fundamental aspects of the role you are hired for can change very rapidly with little to no awareness on your end or your peers. This ranges from your bonus plan, who does what task in the rank of seniority, and who is in charge of calling what shot regarding management. They play this off like you have to be dynamic and flexible but it really feels like ( and is ) a free for all and anything goes if management wants to make the change (if its your actual specific job duties). This becomes the most aggravating when it can directly affect your bonus plan. \r\n-Bonus plans change about every few months and goals for the teams and company never seem to have concrete reasoning. At one point, the management team decided to create a goal for a 3 month period when it it was already the 3rd month in and we had no awareness of it for the first two months of the goal period.\r\n-This role is a marathon that you have to sprint for the majority of the race and it is extremely taxing mentally. You are expected to make about 60+ calls a day. The role can often be fluffed as a Travel Job but it should be focused for people who want to grind, are highly competitive, and do not mind repetitive tasks, it is a Sales role after all. \r\n-There is little transparency from the top and they often become very frustrated if you talk about your earnings with peers. Money is a personal topic of course, but most forward thinking and team member appreciating companies are open about what they see in people in earning xxx and tell those earning x less to complete x y and z if they want to get to that earning.",
