You're right that the decision to promote star performers or hire external candidates for management roles is a critically important one.  As part of our development philosophy, we often promote folks into big roles that they need to grow into.  With that in mind, we've intensified our focus on training managers through programs like our bi-annual 2-day New Manager Training, our seasonal Manager Training Workshop series and our weekly Manager Coaching Office Hours.  If you have additional ideas about how we can continue to support and develop our managers, I'd love to hear them!  Thanks,\r\n\r\nMike Kaufman, Sr. Director of People Operations",
