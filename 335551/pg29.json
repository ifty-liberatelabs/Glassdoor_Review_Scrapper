As for employees there\u2019s no work life balance, you\u2019re expected to do jobs out of your job description regularly because the management staff is lazy or simply not trained. If you\u2019re a woman especially of color you\u2019ll be stuck in a racist toxic environment and if you reach out to hr you\u2019ll be treated worse or fired. I watched a coworker get fired for speaking to hr about not getting lunch breaks after an over 8hr shift ( which is illegal) and speaking out about the racism they experienced at the hand of their mangers. As for the school director, she constantly will remind staff and student that she has over 20 years of experience but you wouldn\u2019t know it by the way she runs the school into the ground and allows mangers to bully their workers.
