Instead we had what I would describe as an inquisition from bitter (sadly, my own, UK + AU) seniors, with a history and a perverse agenda. On just the second week at EF (jetlagged still) i had 'my trainer' barge into my centre without arrangement and state that she would randomly sit in one of my classes, this being my 8th day at EF (It would take the average teacher 3-6 to be very familiar with the vast curriculum). She happened to make it clear at a social after one of her 'training sessions' that 1. She hates my hiring manager, 2. Hates men and 3. Would bully her way to the top (somehow) by guilting EF into making a trainer role for her own career gain (4. Chinese are inferior people according to her also). So put simply, and clearly in hindsight, she bullied her way into watching my classes and stared me down for 90 minutes as I taught things I had only grasped in front of my eyes. Then was posting me 'feedback' (day 9 guys) that was not stipulated or permitted by my CD or hiring manager. My very nice hiring manager, who did actually teach me in his spare time, very well, left the centre before one month had passed. He had then been successfully bullied out and we had a passive local, absolute futile new manager who let this foreign trainer lady and her (same agenda friend) roam free, speaking racist remarks at will, crappy remarks about anyone who was a male with some confidence and just utter disrespect. I was soon confronted by both these ladies who proceeded to talk down to me like a dog on a personal level, and create a new agenda that my manager was bad and I was therefore collateral, because... Look how bad I was on day 9 with 'training' (Mickey mouse) and last minute guidance, which is the only thing that helped. Must be entirely my fault (for joining). Though I had some amazing colleagues who did balance things out because fate can only be so cruel. Another con, the kids are encouraged behind the scenes that they can do anything to a foreigner (physically) and usually you will have a TA not worth the oxygen in the room who will watch you be hit, struck and touched inappropriately and they will proceed to keep face. So prepare to have no rights, unless you have the 'right face' (yes, the 'right face' does extend to what you think I'm referring to, just check the EF advertisements in China. Was promised figure A sum of wage minimum, on website. Was kept in shadow about this query until arriving in Suzhou from UK and signing, figure B salary was 4500 less in total.",
